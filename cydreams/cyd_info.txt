This is the original pack of demos for the CyberDreams megawad.
All these demos were recorded a long time ago (1999-2000) with vanilla doom2.exe v1.9. Most of them still show a large number of tricks that can be used to decrease exit times close to its possible limits.

The following ones were recorded by Gonzalo Perez de la Ossa:

04uv009z.lmp
04uv012a.lmp
05uv004z.lmp
22uv036z.lmp

Rest of demos recorded by Albert Valls.

Demos which names finish with an "a" are max demos. The ones finishing with a "z" are speed demos.
All of them must be watched using both cyber110.wad and cyber110.deh files, and have been tested with PrBoom-Plus 2.5.0.6.
