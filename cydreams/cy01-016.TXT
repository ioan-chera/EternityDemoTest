  Description :)

  Just a normal trick, the exit sign prevents you jumping
  over exit earlier. This is the optimal time for Max and
  Speed but if someone manages to get a rocket to kill him
  and push your corpse in the right direction to slide
  under the exit sign and over the wall that's still lowering
  That could save 1 second for Speed :P
