 ³ 1. INTRODUCTION ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 First of all, let's make a revision of the files you MUST have in your
 Doom ][ directory after unzipping the compressed file. Here they are:

                    CYBER.BAT    - Batch file to install and play Cyberdreams.
                    DEHACKED.EXE - The Greg Lewis program to modify the
				   original .EXE file.
                    CYBER110.DEH - Dehacked modifications for Cyberdreams.
                    CYBER110.WAD - Main WAD of Cyberdreams.
                    CYDREAMS.TXT - You're reading it right now.
                    FILE_ID.DIZ  - .DIZ description of Cyberdreams.


 So, as you probably guessed, the way to run Cyberdreams can't be easier.
 Just type 'cyber' at your Doom ][ prompt.

 Well, and now the key question: WHAT IS CYBERDREAMS?
 In our opinion, we consider that Cyberdreams can be described, first, as a
 pile of Doom levels in which the point is killing Cyberdemons in several
 ways and situations. But if you have been playing Doom for a long time and
 have tried the different playing modes (solo, deathmatch and ctf - who the
 hell plays cooperative?), after finishing Cyberdreams maybe you'll have the
 sensation that this is a different way of playing Doom in which you probably
 never thought before.

 Killing a Cyber never was so difficult in the original game: you had a lot
 of weapons and ammunitions to fulminate them in a second. The difference in
 Cyberdreams is that your only "weapons" will be your movements, your
 strategy and a bit of your imagination. The only real weapon that you'll
 be able to use (and just in a few maps) will be the pistol. And not for
 killing a Cyber, but for doing other things (anyway, killing a Cyber with
 the pistol seems completely ridiculous and boring...).

 You'll find while playing Cyberdreams that in some levels you can exit
 without killing all the Cybers. We really tried to avoid it, but in some
 cases it seems impossible, because of the design of the level. At least
 for us it's clearly obvious that the REAL point of each map is kill them
 all before exiting. Think about it.

 We think the best way to realize what Cyberdreams is is to start trying it.
 And if you get interested in the first levels, you'll probably enjoy the
 rest of them, which become more attractive and complex. The ambientation
 of the maps is in most of the cases simple and accurate as well. We have
 been designing Doom levels for more than a year and a half and we almost
 have imagined everything that can be done using Doom editors. We got tired
 a long time ago of seeing the same kind of maps with the same kind of
 structures. In general, people have forgotten that risk can be one of the
 best tools while designing. In Cyberdreams levels there is a bit of that
 risk, and a bit of our experience. All we can say is that we tried to make
 the detailing and the texture alignments in an almost perfect way. For the
 rest of the things, the veredict belongs to you. We'll surely respect your
 opinion, but first... please take a look at the whole adventure.

 One last thing: the Dehacked modifications refer only to text sequences,
 weapons, ammunitions and cheat codes. The behaviour of
 Cyberdemons and the rest of the things KEEPS BEING THE SAME as in the
 original Doom. Maybe YOUR behaviour won't be the same after playing this
 adventure, but...

 So that's the story. As simple as it seems. We're dying to see what's your
 opinion about Cyberdreams. Just remember that there is more information
 in this text file that can be interesting for you while (or even after)
 playing it. Thank you and good luck.

                           The map is so amazing that probably you will not

                           Oh, and don't try to save in map 30, or the game
                           will crash. Again, we know the reason, but we
                           can't tell you more...

 ³ 3. THE BEHAVIOUR OF CYBERDREAMS ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 While making the adventure we had to change a bit our way of designing. We
 had ideas for Cyberdreams that seemed to be not comprehensible for any
 Doom editor. In fact, we have a few maps which still stay just as good
 ideas but not possible to turn them into a reality.

 Still, the main reason to write this chapter in the text file is to explain
 some of the important things that can happen while playing the adventure and
 which can be considered as "errors", though they are just limitations of
 the Doom engine. Most of them are on behalf of how the Cyber is killed.

 1) The first, and probably the most desperating one, is that sometimes,
 Cyberdemons won't die in levels 4, 11, 12, 19 and 30. We are almost sure
 that in Doom, Cybers can die only in three ways:

        - building stairs below them when the ceiling is low enough
          to "squeeze" the Cyber.
        - crushers that can be activated by a switch or an invisible line.
        - ... and of course by teleporting.

 In those maps, we use the first method and without any apparent reason
 stairs don't kill the Cybers. Maybe it depends on every little thing that
 is being done within the map at the moment that they are activated (player
 actions, moving sectors, or Cyber movements). If any Doom designer has ever
 been in a similar situation and knows more about this problem, we'll
 appreciate his comments (see email above).

 2) With the second method it seems that switches never fail, altough lines
 sometimes do. Once again, this is not just a Cyberdreams problem, but one
 thing that can happen in the original game as well. Lines don't always
 activate when the player crosses them at high speeds. This can happen in
 two different circumstances: using turbo (something that you can't do in
 Cyberdreams) or crossing the line just after receiving some special "kiss"
 of any Cyber, which makes you gain speed inmediately. This can happen in
 three or four levels, but basically in levels 21 and 31 (we really hope
 not!).

 3) Fortunately we are absolutely sure that every time you teleport into
 a place where a Cyber stays things will work correctly (that is, the third
 method NEVER fails...).

 There is a "moral" problem that you'll notice in some levels if you
 save your game. If Cyber wasn't facing you at the moment you
 desperately pressed F2 and took a deep breath, the next time you reload it
 the Cyber won't move or even know where you are until you let him know.
 If you go on with this game without "waking him up" it can be considered
 as cheating. That's the reason why we think the best way to play Cyberdreams
 is without saving. If you ever use saved games, please be honest and use
 your fist (remember you can use the fist?) or let him (them) know where you
 are if the Cybers are apparently swimming into wet dreams. This is very
 important specially in map 21.

 Finally, we hope you'll discover some strange things that can happen in
 some levels. They are not errors at all, but curious to see.

 ³ 4. RECORDING DEMOS ³
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
 
 To record a demo, you must write the following line in your Doom ][ prompt:

      cydreams -game cyber110.wad -dream XX -record namedemo

 where:

  - XX is the number of the map you wish to record the demo.
  - namedemo is the name of your demo (that's what we call a wasted line in
    a text file...)

  And in case you want to see some demo you recorded, just type:

      cydreams -game cyber110.wad -playdream namedemo


 Important: in Cyberdreams the extension of your demos will be .CYB, altough
 you don't need to type it in any case.
 We hope this little change won't bother the authors of original Doom if they
 ever know that Cyberdreams exists. Thanks again to id.

 Send us your demos, we'll appreciate it very much... There are some levels
 that were not included in Cyberdreams but are finished. We'll be delited to
 send them to you if we can enjoy your playing against Cybers.

 And if you can't find the way to solve some of the levels... well, you can
 do it better, man! Seriously, we have recorded demos of all levels that can
 be helpful to you. Ask for the one(s) you need.
