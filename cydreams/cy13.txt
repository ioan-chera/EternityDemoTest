Comments:  Recorded without using cyber110.deh, but except UV-Max i didn't
           use pistol and .lmps behave 100% the same with dehacked file.
           In max run I helped crusher with the pistol, ~15 bullets are enough
           to kill the cybers from both sides under 0:49!
           The middle one must receive more damage as he stands
           slightly lower and crusher reach him later.
           Remained bullets from outside then fist damage from exit passage is barely enough.
           0:48.37 - first cyber died
           0:48.49 - second cyber died
           0:48.71 - the last cyber died
           0:48.89 - Doomguy reached the exit teleport! Yeah!
           The trick is impossible on -Fast, cybers are able to shoot even under crusher...
           NM-Speed is not hard, you just need to pass between 3-shots.
