Pwad:      CyberDreams
Map:       01-30 (without the secret levels)
Skill:     ITYTD
Category:  speedrun movie (some runs are Max, though)
Exe:       Boom v2.02 with cyber110.deh

Time: 	   32:01

Comments:  The demo shows that it is possible to get a whole movie of this megawad, despite the tiny
	   CyD-Boom incompatibilities. The 667-tagged sector on map 07 raises twice the high it is
	   supposed to race. Other than that, some crushers on maps 13 and 17 behave in a different way
	   than the usual.

	   Special thanks to Opulent.
