Description:

This has taken far longer to make than it ought to have done, annoyingly.
Credit to Vile for the start method - I don't know how far he realised it
with his run, but it's actually a perfectly reproducible method for getting
a great start, which is really rather handy. You just have to time the pause
and stand at the right angle on the green armour and the monsters *always*
do the same things, leaving the path clear for you to get back. Rest of this
level is more or less pure adrenaline, and quite a lot of fun to run, though
it can get immensely frustrating. Interestingly, I reckon this route could
get under 1:00 if everything went perfectly...
