  Description :-)

  Incredible that I finally got this, first of
  all I tried this 2 months ago and got 28.05
  after 3 solid hours of trying. I was drained
  totally and looked for relatively easier stuff
  to record (and I also knew that I don't have
  any chance without a clean mouse and pad).
  
  I tried this tonight again, first I thought I
  could get it easy, my runs indicated I can have
  a very small mistake and still make it.
  I made lots of silly mistakes near the end though
  (like missing the exit switch press at 27.82 once
  etc.) and that's why this took me 1100 tries tonight.
  
  Anyway, it beats DOOM Done Quicker by 2 seconds,
  Yonatan's TAS run by 1 second and Pacifist as well.

  I'm still pretty frustrated by these:
