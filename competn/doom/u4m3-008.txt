  Then this should be another proove that you can never know what 
  tommorow brings, ha? ;).
  Yourney for this record was something what I will remember 
  for a long long time...
  I can't really explain to you how hard I worked on this demo, lets
  just say that this is DEFENETLY second most harded demo I worked on.
  First one is obviously lv24-036 but thats something what I can't 
  compare with any other demo i did in my life.
  
  Hope you won't find this demo as 8 seconds of wasted time...
  becouse I think that you won't see any faster run on this map 
  in future ;).
