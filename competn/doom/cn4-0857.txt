-------- E4M1 ------- 
Vincent : Nothing very hard here, some deaths anyway. We changed the route here
          very lately. It allows to grab the plasma gun and the chaingun which
          help a lot for the next levels. (a lot easier than on solo)
Selim   : This level is sure far easier than on solo, and we managed to do it almost all the 
          time during our later tries. Since its being so easy kinda ruined the watcher's fun :),
          we decided to be brave and go down in the monsters' cave to get the plasma and chaingun.
          It can get really funny when a nightmare-boosted baron spawns right in front of you :))

-------- E4M2 ------- 
Vincent : Selim's domain, I just lure some cacos and grab the sphere.
Selim   : The beginning can be tricky if u r low on health, but the grab and jump far made easier
          by vincent's caco luring. The only prob then is the last room, where caco fry your ass
          if the cybbies doesn't have the time to kill you before :) Fortunately, I had spent "a 
          little" time playing the level, so here I lost very few health.

-------- E4M3 ------- 
Vincent : I let selim do the route until the red key. Then it's my turn.
          The extra health, ammo and invul. help a lot too. I grab the BFG here.
Selim   : We decided to go for a risky beginning, vincent following me w/o being invulnerable, while
          I blew everything to hell up to the red key. The rest is piece of cake if we make no stupid
          mistake.

-------- E4M4 ------- 
Vincent : Nothing much to report, it's a piece of cake.
Selim   : I don't agree ... it can be a bit hard to stay alive if ... uhmmm... if your mouse gets 
          accidentaly disconnected, for exemple :)

-------- E4M5 ------- 
Vincent : Safe play... would be silly to ruin a good health start for E4M6 
Selim   : Yeah, I do nothing here except chosing a good place to hide :)
     
-------- E4M6 ------- 
Vincent : Wow, the "hard" thing in EP4, we practised it for a whole afternoon with
          fillup.wad. And I think we've found a nice route, which fully takes
          advantage of coop modus. (Watch both view here, both do important things)
Selim   : This level is, IMO, the hardest in Udoom/doom2. After having died here at least ten times,
          we decided to make a fillup session which lasted at least 8 hours :) I really think our 
          route is very good indeed, we almost planned it to the gametic. This was the first time
          we got past it in a run.

-------- E4M7 ------- 
Vincent : The start here was a dilema, Selim had low health. So I Alt-Tabbed to windows,
          and we started speaking of what we should do. Then we finally agreed on a 
          strategy. It seems it worked. We were both very nervous while playing this one. 
Selim   : From here my playing sucks a lot. I don't have vincent's or henning's experience of 
          resisting the stress in a nm run, so my hands were shaking like hell. I was very careful
          not to die in the beginning, then once we had the inv. on it was piece of cake.. till the
          last room. I don't know why we were mad enough to try the shotgun boost, but it's really
          a miracle we got it done. Look at it from vincent's POV, it actually slalom in the air ;)

-------- E4M8 ------- 
Vincent : IMO, this one is a joke :) ... tons of health and ammo, impossible to die.
Selim   : I was watching vincent's screen in the end so I didn't realize monsters were actually
          hitting me :))
