C-N entry #143, movie run #29.

My first maxkills movie, and perhaps my last, unless I decide
to improve this one later on.  I wasn't very satisfied with the
way this one came out.  I can't watch this one without cringing
at some of my sloppy movements, but oh well, you'll probably enjoy
it without worrying about the little details like me. :)
