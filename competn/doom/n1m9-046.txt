                       Going for the chaingun takes so long, so I decided to cut
                       it out and do the map with shotgun only, little suspecting
                       what I was letting myself in for.  This run must be one
                       the worst in the doom IMHO.  Its not the most difficult
                       and there are more annoying spots in other runs, but none
                       are so _consistantly_ annoying and unpleasant.  From the
                       moment you start til you reach the exit you're under constant
                       fire from the imps, seargents and troopers.   Should you
                       avoid their fire, there's about 100 demons ready to surround
                       you and eat you in about two seconds.  If that wasn't
                       annoying enough you have to use the RL in enclosed situations
                       and make a jump at the end of the lmp with monsters firing
                       at you from all directions.  If I ever see Romero I'm going
                       to shout "n1m9!" and punch him.

'Nuff said. :)
