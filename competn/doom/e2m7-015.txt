The monster glide trick returns.  It's hard
to tell how many more seconds can be cut from
the time, since it's hard to judge exactly how
long to build up the st50 run by strafing against
the monster.  Either way, I don't like the way
this one looks.  Perhaps I'll continue trying..

Props to Dash again for the inspiration here. :)
