  Description :-)

This is technically a DdQr-beater...however, the initial jump to switch is
rather a lot harder to do under ddqstats.exe (I checked it, the finer control
of doom.exe comes in real handy). I knew this was possible since I made a
0:17 with one BFG shot wasted into pinkies while I was messing around for
DANG MI12. 0:15 is possible on the old route with the straight-to-switch
jump, but the problem is that the faster you go at the start, the more likely
cacos are to block SW jump, so I don't know if anyone will manage that. It's
also just about possible on this route, but probably pretty tough.
