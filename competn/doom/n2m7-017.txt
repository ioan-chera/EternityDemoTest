Quite a large improvement here, and it wasn't
because of no rocket jump.  Sorta new trick. :)

Me and Dash have been really getting into some
trick analysis just for the hell of it, and the
first benefits of said research have materialized.
This harkens back to the discussion about the thing
glides in a recent thread by Grazza, so I think
this makes a good continuation of that.  I made
no real effort to optimize this, as this is the
first demo using the trick that beat the record...
yeah, 4 seconds shaved off instantly.
