Comments : 
E1M1 : /
E1M2 : Yes, this ugly run is a 1:05...
E1M3 : Nice run here
E1M9 : The ending was a bit messy, but it's nice to have a quicker way to kill these
       spectres
E1M4 : Usual run
E1M5 : I'm very disappointed... I made too much mistakes. At the end I nearly pressed a
(yeah, on french keyboards it's not q). It should be possible to take 10s off here.
E1M6 : I lost some time at the beginning, due to my badly aimed rocket at E1M5,
       otherwise the run was very smooth.
E1M7 : No surprise here, my run is always the same on this map.
E1M8 : /

Overall, that's a nice improvement over Vile's time. It's mostly a better use of the
rocket launcher, and some better running at some points...
This episode is the funniest to play, especially in nm100s. I might improve this run
again. I think an optimal time should be just under 10:00 (according to my best times),
but it would require a huge load of luck. Maybe, one day... :)

Of course, thanks to all who ran this episode before. I watched their demos several times,
before thinking of some possible route improvements.
That was a real pleasure recording this demo, so I hope you will appreciate the results
of my efforts here ;)
