  Description :)
  Ya! First to complete a UV -RESPAWN movie!! Can't believe nobodies
  done this yet.

  My goal was to beat 29:11, which is Radek Pecka's time for EP2-2911,
  obviously.

  At E2M6, I usually exited with 98-99% kills and after 3 days of trying
  for this, I decided to go way over kill just to make sure. I also went
  over kill on E2M7 just because I had gotten so far and didn't want to
  ruin it at the end.

  But anyways, this is so fun. I'm so glad I gave UV -RESPAWN a chance,
  I may even like it better than UV -FAST which for a long time, I
  considered my favorite category.

  I hope more people get involved with UV -RESPAWN movies, it would be
  real cool to see these Episodes optimized, as my run is far from optimized.

  See ya!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :P
