  Description :)

  I've been trying some e3m1 recently so I thought I'd try it's
  big brother map.  I got 1:05 pretty early, and Sedlo didn't
  like it because of some ugly running, so I worked to improve it.
  I had quite a few 1:05's and higher because those monsters can
  be really rude, but finally I got a run where I didn't get slowed
  down too much by them.  Hey, they were even polite enough to open
  a door for me :)  The time up to the e3m1 exit is pretty bad.  I
  lost 1-2 seconds on the pig so it's still far from perfect.
  Optimal time could be around 1 minute.
