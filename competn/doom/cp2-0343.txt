   In this level, I lower the elevator as fast as I can to get a fast time. Then, it's all up to JCD. Also, I have hit JCD unwillingly.
   
   E2M2
   I took the green armor and some shotgun shells. Then, I wait for the exit.
   
   E2M3
   I tried to help JCD as most by opening the door, letting the demons out, and then, taking the Red... aah. MegaArmor.
   
   E2M4
   I got a lot of life, so I do my best to open the colored doors! Also, linedef jump...
   
   E2M5
   I took the chaingun for later, the mini-cells, and waited for JCD.
   
   E2M6 
   I tried to be as fast as possible for JCD to make the void glide, and to exit the level.
   
   E2M7   
   Well, practicing again our shotgunboost skills :).
   
   E2M8
   I ... FORGOT my rocket launcher!
