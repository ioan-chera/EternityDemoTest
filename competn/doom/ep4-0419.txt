The big advantage would come on E4M3 by performing a rocket jump on a 
lost soul. Unfortunately the trick failed in this recording, so I had
to use a backup route that succeded well this time. 

Since the the backpack is left, the following parts of the run become
even harder, so I needed really lot of tries to complete the ep. I am
not satisfied with the run (below 4:00 would be nice), but I don't think
I will ever have enough free time to improve it :(. 

Enjoy!
