             Well, I needed rest from current uvspeed project I'm
             workin' on so I was just lookin around in c-n database
             and run on to my e2m9 uv record. I wondered who got 
             nightmare record after all and when I checked on my 
             suprise I descavored that Panter still holds it.
             Heh, I decided to give it a try to see is it maybe
             harder then I expected back then when I made uv rec...
             took me four tries to get this time...so this one
             quallify for the eaziest record I ever done...big 
             difference between Uv and Nm on this one. I'm 
             confused atm...how come noone took this so far?

             Well, anyway back to my game...UV speed ofcourse :).
