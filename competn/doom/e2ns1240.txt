C-N entry #150, movie run #30.

Well, at least it's better than my previous e2ns..
I dunno, I can't enjoy watching my own movies, so
tell me what you think.  I would go on to improve
e3ns, but I promised some other movies for Casey
and Sedlo.  I heard Adam Hegyi had a faster run
after I uploaded the 10:09, what happened to that
one, Adam? :)
