[ JC : ] 

We do not know what map record, so we chose e2m6 in this category :p
I picked up two secrets when I was in the void :)

[ Ch0Ww : ]
  
Now that those monsters died and JCD doing his void-glide, I managed to get the secret as fast as I can. 
He was BRILLIANT to find all those incredible ideas !
