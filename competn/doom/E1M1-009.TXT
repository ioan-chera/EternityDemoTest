Description: Hmmm...this Strafe-running from the first GT is really nice (:
             Anyway...this one came really fast...and it's not THAT perfect
             as you may think...I just walk around everything...

             I hope I'm the first one who uploads this 'cause Baum wanted to
             do this too...hehe
