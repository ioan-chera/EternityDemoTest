I'm not yet satisfied with my efforts here,
though in all honesty, this is probably one
of those runs where I never will be satisfied.
Too much depends on monster cooperation and
as such, I can't expect a completely smooth
run.  Once school work calms down again, I
might return for another run, since it IS a
fun episode.  Props to all who previously ran
this episode, especially Adam Williamson the
episode 1 specialist and angry pacifist. ;)

Note that I'm wiping out all traces that I
ever used that AOL account as you can see,
since a perfectly good university email is at
my disposal.  Shown below:
