  # Description:  # Hi folks :)                                                       #
  ################# I can't believe that such luck happened to me, I started  played  #
  # this level ( one of my favourite ) almost 1 year ago just for fun, I had no idea  #
  # that was possible to beat this record. After several tries I noticed that 1  pig  #
  # at NM can kill me in 2 seconds, so it means 100%. So,  many of them  should have  #
  # killed the barons in 30 seconds or less, but at first I never had that luck.      #
  # Then I realized that it wasn't necessary shot the barrels and take the  chaingun  #
  # because pigs can be faster than your chaingun's fire power, and finally around 6  #
  # months ago I made 46, but I recorded that demo with Doom95 ( I didn't have  Doom  #
  # for DOS yet).                                                                     #
  # Then I tried this again with Vanilla Doom and I was really lucky,  expecially at  #
  # the end, I also didn't hit the first barons, but I'm satisfied with this.         #
  # Hope you'll enjoy watch the demo :)                                               #

  # Special thank go to my bro, edgar89, who helped me with vanilla doom, he's  kind  #
  # of the mind, I'm the arm :)                                                       #

  # See ya folks :)                                                                   #
