Description:  

I've never been entirely happy with my 0:47, but it's taken a lot of odd
1/2 hour sessions to bring this time :). Everything worked out OK here,
except running into a wall in the first secret area...doh. I was a little
careful in there due to my somewhat, uh, lacking health ;). I'd stick to
my last prediction of 0:43 for human optimal, but I think this could be
done outrageously fast TAS - under 0:40 maybe. A big innovation over my
last run is figuring out that you can avoid alerting a set of 3 imps in
the switch cellar while shooting the barrel (it's not very easy, though).
