===================================
Description:

Old record which was 1:38 was made in 1999 and a jump to a red key was not 
used in the run. The old record could be definitely improved for this trick, 
but no one had touched it over 15 years. I understood this reason soon after 
trying it. It was terrible luck game, unlike NM-Speed, and it was not at all 
fun. I am satisfied with this result itself.
