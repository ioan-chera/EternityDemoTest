  Description :)

  When I first started playing this map I was just practicing
  for e3m9 to see if I could save enough shells to use the trick.
  After getting 31 and then 30 I knew that 29 was possible, so I
  kept going for it.  Then I discovered that it's possible to use
  only 3 shots on the imps and also that it isn't even hard.
  Still, it would take a lot of luck to kill every pig in 2 shots
  and then finish the run with a 3 shot ending, but I knew that I
  could do it and that if I could get it I would have a record that 
  would last a while.  Anyways, this beats DOOM done quicker by 2
  seconds and Yonatan's TAS run by 1 second.  Hope you enjoy this,
  because I put a lot of effort into this run.
