  I'm back to this episode again, the best time
  I had last year was 3:53 exactly like Hi Jango's record.
  I decided to devote less hours per day to the run to
  remain cool. The run was really good from my part, I
  only don't like the slowdowns at E3M4 and the skipped
  line at E3M6.. but it's difficult for everything
  to go right :)
  Hope you'll enjoy the flashing finish at E3M7
  I was totally on fire :D

  Funny after I finished the run, I felt that it was way too easy
  and that I should try to do a run with less mistakes but
  I know exactly what will happen if I try again
  FRUSTRATIONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
