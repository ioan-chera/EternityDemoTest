I left out the numbers for the entries because
I think I really screwed up the proper numbers
for both somewhere along the line... oh well,
it was a good idea while it lasted, I think.

Not much to say here, I just felt like trying
this episode since I hadn't previously done so
(straight speed, not for the 100% secrets tally)
and kept at it until it got too annoying to
continue.  So, I'm uploading what I have instead
of holding onto it for no good reason.  Enjoy. :)

E3m4 was my least favorite map in this run, from
the number of aesthetic foulups like the first
bfg shot, the end demon, and the troublesome key
grab.  I leveled it out with decent improvements
to maps like e3m7, and also eliminated the long
e3m8 run that was present in the previous record
by AdamH.  I had enough health to charge in and
topple him in a hurry this time. :)
