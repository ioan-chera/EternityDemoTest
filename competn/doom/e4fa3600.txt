Description:  Well, if you're not yet bored of watching -fast movies, here's
              another one. Takes about twenty minutes off my first attempt.
              Record times are quite low but I chose to go more safer ways...


The levels:

E4M1 (Hell Beneath)
  The red key grab isn't hard, but this is a bit easier.
E4M2 (Perfect Hatred)
  Missed the jump!
E4M9 (Fear)
  Plasma rifle helps a lot at the start. Not much health though...
E4M3 (Sever the Wicked)
  Usual run. Time to relax.
E4M4 (Unruly Evil)
  And more relaxing.
E4M5 (They Will Repent)
  Kill every soul :)
E4M6 (Against Thee Wickedly)
  The end turned out to be pretty close here...
E4M7 (And Hell Followed)
  I start getting paranoid about missing monsters... and with good reason.
E4M8 (Unto the Cruel)
  Probably too cautious.
