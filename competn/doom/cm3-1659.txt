Vincent (green) :

	This was made quite in a rush, we got the routes quick and got this
        within a few tries. You can see a lot of goofy moments. And the routes 
        most likely need quite a bit of optimizing :) Some maps gave us troubles 
        with a couple alive monsters (E3M3 and E3M5 come to mind).
        It was anyway quite fun to play and constitute an honorable 1st entry for
        this category.
