C-N entry #165, movie run #33.

Returning to my movie roots here.  I was a bit
disappointed by the time and some shaky play on
e1m7, but otherwise it went ok... maybe I'll dig
up the will to improve this run sometime soon,
otherwise I hope you enjoy this improvement over
that ultra-shaky 6:59.  :)

Let me know what you think of the run so I can
decide if attempting further improvements will
be well met, along with any possible suggestions.
