	Nice improvement. I tried here Ocelot's and Henning's tactics that
        consists in "just run and care about nothing" :). 
	Henning told me he's trying that episode too... but he's using another route 
        on e4m6... (w/o the invul).. this way he could end up around 1:30 (instead of
        2:50). But it's a lot tougher to kill a skill 5 cyber in a narrow room w/o invul ;)
	I might try it if Henning beats me and for the NM speed episode run.
