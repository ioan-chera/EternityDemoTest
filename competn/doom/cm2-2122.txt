Torn (indigo) : 

     never run forward vincent before he about to shot, you will see that in 
     e2m1. :P I also did a couple of mistakes in e2m6 in the room with the 
     caco, souls, green armor, etc, was close to die in that room. :( Overall
     a good run, imo. We missed no enemies this time in e2m2, great!.

Vincent (green) :

     Enjoyable run. In fact I think I could play this episode in max quite often
     I really like it. Maybe one day you're going to see an update ?
     We played this one quite slow, cause we missed quite a bunch monsters 
     sometimes, which is quite annoying.
     I guess under 19 mins would be a nice run.

Recorded on MSN ZoneLan, ping ard. 130 ms. with some lag sometimes.
