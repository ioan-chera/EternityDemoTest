  [00:28] <Sedlo> john...screw max do some speed

  Here you go Sedlo :P
  Actually I started playing this one a while back.  I thought
  it would be a quicky an easy point, especially since I got 
  0:29 very easily.  As it turned out it was a real nasty one,
  but at least I've got it now.

  I think this equals ddq as well.
