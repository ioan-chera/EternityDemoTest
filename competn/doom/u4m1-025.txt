Description: 

	When asked me to come into the DDQR teams i didn't what i 
        could do since that i had so good partners. 
        Even if someone found the trick before me (activating the lift 
        while running/jumping to the switch), i found it by myself
        while looking for a map i could do for them.
      
        Besides that, this map is really frustrating... here almost everything
        came very well and quickly. Except for that imp i killed in the blue key room...
        he was just walking away quietly. Thats why it's not yet optimized..
        24s maybe 23s is possible... i've spend days trying to improve it...
        w/o success. Maybe for another day...another man :)
