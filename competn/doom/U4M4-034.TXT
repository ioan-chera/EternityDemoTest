A rare new trick for Ultimate Doom, a 32-unit flat-face 
exit glide. It saves about 3s in regular play, maybe 5s 
in a built run. Trouble is, it's a seriously hard one to 
do, and I don't find the rest of the run too easy either. 

But, hundreds of tries later and I finally shaved off the
last second to get this, my first Compet-N on a "true" 
Doom map. It turned out fairly well - the glide alignment
took a while, but there's only one missed shot, unlike 
some of my earlier tries which had them sprayed all over 
the place. I didn't use the jump from the existing route 
because I had so little success with it. So good luck on 
getting it down to 0:33, or even lower!
