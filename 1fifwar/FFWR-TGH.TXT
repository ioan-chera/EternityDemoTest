Comments:  
More Fiffy action.  My next level to record on after FIFFY2.WAD was going to be
FIFFY3.WAD, until I noticed that its description directly referred to Total War
II, which is not available on the idgames archive.  One search through a
shovelware disc archive later, I ended up finding 1FIFWAR.ZIP on the Night Owl
Games 3 disc.  I would have downloaded it from George Fiffy's personal website,
but it's been dead and buried since AOL shut down its site-hosting service in
October 2008.  Anyway, FIFFYWAR.WAD contains three different levels, and I
recorded separate demos for each one.  Here are my comments on the levels.

E1M1: TOTAL WAR -
I was wrong; FIFFY.WAD wasn't George Fiffy's first level, it was /this/ one.
It's a round pool in which you fight a small army that includes a Cyberdemon
and a Spiderdemon, with an exit switch that can be flipped in a matter of
seconds.  This is actually a "remake" of the level, in which, among other
things, George added some secret rooms behind (as usual) totally unmarked
doors.  Apparently, the original didn't even have an exit!  If you want a tough
level, look elsewhere; as in his other levels, there's far too much ammo for the
34 monsters to be a threat.  At least he admits the level is bad.

The speed demo is a first exit, while the max demo was preceded by a 2:06 run.

E1M2: TOTAL WAR II -
The sequel is markedly different from the original.  Whereas the first had just
34 monsters, Total War II has hundreds of them.  The first few are packed into
a small room, and there are enough of them to overload Doom's visible sprites
limit, causing many of them to flicker in and out of existence.  You start the
level with a Fiffian stockpile of ammo nearby -- which, hilariously, is /also/
enough to overload the sprite limit.  After the first area is a door labeled
"WAR," beyond of which is the "Total War" described in the title.  Unlike what
George tells you, this is /not/ "THE WORLD'S TOUGHEST DOOM LEVEL."  It /might/
have been at some point in time, but it's nothing compared to Hell Revealed II.
The only possibly tough parts are the secrets; as Fiffy admits in the text file,
none of them are marked.  Still, he could have at least tried to mark them
somehow, 'cause finding them is an annoying Wolfenstein-style wall-humping
affair.  Speaking of which, only 83% Secrets is possible, as Fiffy also admits,
once again due to improperly deleted sectors.

Oh, yeah, and there's also the issue that the monster teleporters into the blue
key room are /slow./  This is because the teleporters themselves are 64×64
teleport pads in rooms which are 200 units wide on a Y axis.  This is especially
boneheaded when the monsters who are to be teleported include hellspawn who are
60 map units wide (i.e. demons and spectres.)  As I result, I end up having to
check that room multiple times during the max demo just to see if any more
monsters have warped in.  Annoying, isn't it?

The speed demo and max demo were preceded by 1:03 and 8:46 demos, respectively.
Highlights of the max demo include a group of completely worthless monsters on a
thin pathway, and cyberdemons that don't appear until after I've killed them,
even though there are no other monsters or items on the screen.

E1M8: Revenge Of the big suckers! [sic] -
And here, we have the likely reason this WAD isn't on idgames: The third level
is an edit of E1M8.  Because there are four more barons on the level besides
the ones you fight normally, the lowering of the wall around the star is instead
triggered through a switch, which makes me wonder why he left it on E1M8 when he
could've just moved it to E1M3 and left it at that.  The original exit is now
brightly lit, has a switch you must flip, and can be escaped, after which you
must run into some new areas built into the level.  You don't get any more
rockets after the first of these areas until you reach the last part of the
level, so you'll need to take on the cacodemons with your (berserked) fists,
chaingun and shotgun after you run out.

Like the original level, this version ends within a dark room in which you lose
health and "die."  It also provides the reason the max demo ends with only 99%
Kills: If you pass through the middle of the room, a cyberdemon is released on
you, and as far as I can tell, there's no way to kill him apart from cheating.
Even if you take the hidden invincibility nearby, its power will run out before
you can kill him with the ammo you have left.  This is why I knock myself down
to low health before exiting the level.  Overall, I'm left wondering why Fiffy
didn't just make the third level an original one.

Both demos are first exits.
