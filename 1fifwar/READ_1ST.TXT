  REoL TOUGH: The Total War package.  3 new levels for the KNEE DEEP
episode. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TEXT! Some things here are IMPORTANT!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  THESE INCLUDE AUTOMATIC DEMOS! DEMOS ARE KNOWN TO CRASH! Please turn
          off your EMM386 Memory manager if this does happen.

TO ENTER THE MAYHEM, At the DOOM prompt, type:  DOOM -FILE FIFFYWAR.WAD

          CHAPTER 1: TOTAL WAR 1, First ever REoL TOUGH level.

   This is a remake of WAR.WAD, the first ever DOOM level made by me. As
you will see, the construction is very shoddy, and of poor quality. Your
first mission is to destroy all the end bosses (and some regulars). In
spite of lousy construction, the level is pretty tough to do, yet just
about anyone could do it after some practice.

MAJOR MODIFICATIONS FOR TOTAL WAR 1 INCLUDE:

   * An EXIT switch! You can now get out of there when you're done, or
     when the action gets a little too much for you.
   * SECRETS!: There is now a couple secret rooms added to this level.
     Construction is that of the good REoL TOUGH levels, but is joined
     or built to match the lousy construction.
   * MORE AMMUNITION! A little more ammo is around, and lots more if you
     can find the secret rooms.
   * DEATH MATCH SUPPORT Now had four starting spots. Grab the waepons
     quickly, before your friends get them all!

KNOWN BOO-BOOS:
        Just the shoddy construction. Walls may not touch, dissapear,
"fuse" together in weird ways, and the like. Was a beginner then!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            CHAPTER II: TOTAL WAR II (available as WAR2.WAD)

            THIS IS THE WORLD'S TOUGHEST DOOM LEVEL! Enjoy!

        If you play higher than HEY, NOT TO ROUGH, you're INSANE!
    At this, and even I'M TO YOUNG TO DIE, this level plays WORSE than
           ULTRA VIOLENT. Don't even THINK about NIGHTMARE!!!

   After kicking major butt in your first mission, the millitary forces
in Hell were PO'd big time! They vowed to get even, and will increase
resistance up to 200 TIMES! You start in a dark hallway. After grabbing
your guns and ammo, you head to the first room. It's somewhat large, and
there are (up to) HUNDEREDS of enemies waiting for you! Oh, Did I also
mention that there are (up to) 16 barrons joining forces with them??????
You fight like hell through the first few areas of the game, then all of
a sudden, in red letters, the word "WAR" was lit up on the floor. A loud
voice is heard saying: "You survived the training, now it's onto the
REAL THING!". All that work, and it wasn't the TOUGH part! You open the
door, and you're greeted by (up to) 50 daemons, troopers, imps, and
sargents, up to 200 enemies coming at you as soon as you open the door!
  In Deathmatch, you're all in the warfield. you have your own arsenal
layed out in front of you.

INTERESTING FEATURES:
* The big green teleporter is one of those where enemies come out of
them. It's not like those other WIMPY ones that ID SOFTWARE or other
people make! Get the blue keycard and see for yourself!
* Secrets are nearly IMPOSSIBLE to find! (without cheats.) All secret
textures are lined up with the surrounding walls, and appear as walls
on the map! Watch the second demo to see where at least TWO secrets are!
* The platform you enter the first room on is also a lift. Watch the
demo to see which wall to walk up to to activate it.

KNOWN BOO-BOOS:
(1) Did you know there is a limit as to how many sprites can be in the
    same room at once? You'll notice the barrons may be invisable, and
    the rockets in the first weapons storage room (behind the starting
    point) will "vanish" at ceartain angles. Some regulars will also
    be invisable as well (heh, heh, heh!).
(2) Like all levels, even ID SOFTWARE'S, some joints tend to go through
    the floors and ceilings. 
(3) HOPE YOU HAVE A PENTIUM! It's also OK to play on a lower speed 486
    but a high speed 486 or a PENTIUM is prefered (what slowdown?????).
    If you have a high speed 386, you MIGHT be able to play this one!
(4) ONCE AGAIN, THE REDUCED SECRET RATIO: If you score 83% in the SECRET
    DEPARTMENT, you found them all. Can't seem to fix that bug.

    TO START FORM HERE, at the DOOM prompt, type:
        doom -devparm -warp 1 2 -skill n -file fiffywar.wad

Note that n = 1-5, corrosponding to the level of difficulty. 1 is I'M
TO YOUNG TO DIE, and 5 is NIGHTMARE.

                 CHAPTER III, Revenge Of the big suckers!

  This level is ID SOFTWARE'S E1M8, with many additions added to it. At
the "end", there's a red keycard and you'll have to retrace your steps
working your way almost to the start, going through "hidden" passages to
open up the way to the exit.
    IMPORTANT: Due to enemies being added, after killing the barrons at
    the "star room", the walls WILL NOT come down! In one of their
    little booths is a switch you'll have to hit to lower the walls!
    ALSO, there's a SOUL SPHERE in this area. Grab it BEFORE you head
    to the rising steps, or you'll die after teleprting to the "room of
    many monsters" (the original end to this level).

FEATURES:
*  At the beginning, on the other side of the room, is a lift that will
   take you to the medical kits and a computer map power up. You'll
   notice a switch is added. If you accidentally tripped it to go up,
   you can use this switch to regain access to that part of the level.
   You will HAVE to return there some time durring the level to finnish!
*  You know that lift to the barrons at the end of the long hall? Well,
   there's a doorway there! You'll HAVE to trip the Barron's door's 
   open before you can open it. 
   NOTE: After you kill all the monsters in "the room of monsters (re-
   member, it was the orriginal end to this level), there's a keycard
   and teleport to exit the room. You'll return in front of the door
   where the lift is. Open it, and hit the switch on the left, and jump
   onto the lowered lift. As it starts up, run out so you can make your
   way back to the beginning of the level (the end is near there). If
   you're confused about this, watch the third demo.

KNOWN BOO-BOOS:
   Well, just that the walls in the "star room" now don't go down when
   you kill the barrons, so a switch is in one of their booths that will
   lower it.
