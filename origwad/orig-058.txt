Comments:  This one is considered to be the very first user-made wad. And it's fun as hell! Sure, you can reach the exit in just two seconds, but try to get 100% kills and you'll realize that there is much more to it. Good monster infightings are necessary to get a good time and you can't relax for a second while punching the barons. Very satisfied with my time, definitely didn't expect to get sub 1 min.
