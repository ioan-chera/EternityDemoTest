This one should be less nausea-inducing at least.

This took me forever, but now I can say 
I "beat" my other demo, just by rite of non-TAS.

Took most of a month and over 100 attempts I'd estimate.
Switched from using a trackball to a Logitech G703 which
definitely helped.

Props to GuyNamedErick's great demo, whose speed I 
won't accomplish anytime soon.

Thanks again to Jeff Bird of course.
