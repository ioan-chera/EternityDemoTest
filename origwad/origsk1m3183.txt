Comments: Holy h#ck, this level is frustrating! Even considering that I was playing on ITYTD, I'm floored that I managed to get the luck I did so soon,
          I mean, not needing to wait to switch to the pistol after running out of shells and having TWO Imps attacking one of the Barons REALLY helps.
		  While I don't doubt at all that sub-30 is possible (like in 4shockblast's UV Max TAS), I certainly doubt that I'll be the one to get it.
		  I also tried playing *UV* Max on this map, but having to punch the Barons with a non-Berserked fist with <60% health seems to be a death sentence for me most of the time. :-(
