           Goal was sub-20. 2nd enemy dies at 2.31 and it's all tied to weapon swaps and firing time so the 
           optimal time here is 14.33 I think? I didn't think very hard about RNG manipulation in this run, 
           just woke up the Barons and spammed attempts until it worked. Respawn gaming
