Comment:   Wow, the oldest pwad ever! I think in 1994 this map would take me at least 
           10 hours to build :-) Thx to remembert who reminded this map as I would
           probably never know about about it.
           In my 1st tries I tried to implement sargeant into infights too but he cared
           more about me and was stealing me some important health so I started to kill him
           immediately and use only imps vs barons infights.
           My 1st exit was 1:31 so I hoped for something around 1:20-1:25 so I am happy 
           with this time it surely could be still faster with better use of infights
           but well ... I am rather killing them myself :-)
