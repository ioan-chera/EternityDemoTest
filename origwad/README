This is an experimental PWAD file for use with DOOM. It is rather simple
since I cannot generate the nodes structure for anything much more complex
than this. This level has been generated entirely by hand. No editors were
used to produce it.

I know it isn't much, but I released it just to be the producer of the first
completely original WAD file! 8-)


If anyone knows anything more about the NODES and SSECTORS data structure
let me know. As soon as I know, I can start to produce a true level
builder. Any comments to Jeffrey.Bird@jcu.edu.au
