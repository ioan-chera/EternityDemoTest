I made a few stabs at this one after it was mentioned recently on 
Doomworld. This is my third exit, I had a few better attempts wasted. 
You need some luck with the infighting for a fast time. Non-berserk 
punching has never been a favourite of mine (keep in mind I've never 
submitted any Tyson demo, heheh), but I can usually hold my own 
against a Baron. Here, I missed five punches and lost time 
hesitating at least twice. Oh, well.

Thanks to Doomworld Forums member "remembert" for motivation.
