Comments:  

I first recorded a DosBox playthrough of this in 2009 so I could put 
a video on YouTube about it.

I died trying to punch the barons at the end because I'm an embarrassment 
of a Doom player. Anyway since posting this demo will be my 4000th post 
on Doomworld, I wanted to make it something a bit special so I tried to 
make a crazy TAS (my first TAS btw) of me getting "revenge" on these 
barons by circling them and beating them to death. Well it turns out you 
don't run quite fast enough to do that but I hope this will be at least 
somewhat entertaining. 

The YouTube video for this demo is here:

Thanks to Kristian Ronge, whose text file I copied to make this.
