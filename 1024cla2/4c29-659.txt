Description:

You only wait for about 30 seconds after you start this map. 
Certainly it might be a good introduction for a semi-final map, 
but I tried this map again and again for a better record. 
I therefore was always bored of it. After the switch in the 
center of the map were pushed, a lot of enemies teleported and 
I had to stand it for one minute until the switch for releasing 
the cyberdemon appeared. It would have been easy if I had only went 
around the area, but cacodemons prevented it. I was surrounded 
and killed by them easily. In addition, an arch-vile in the upper 
floor was a little tricky. I sometimes couldn't avoid its attack 
for being blocked by enemies. I consume armor points in the trap, 
so I always thought why a green armor could be gotten later. The 
last battle was easy, but I could have killed monsters smoothly 
if I had left a few more rockets. Like I said before, I don't 
like this map's introduction, but the map itself was very exciting. 
I had a good time.
