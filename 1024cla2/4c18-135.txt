Description:

This map is very short. The strategy was very simple. 
You release as many enemies as possible right way and 
you just hope that good monster-infighting occurs. I 
killed a hell knight by telefrag and it was so lucky. 
It would be better if you killed a baron by telefrag. 
Needless to say, it rarely happens.
