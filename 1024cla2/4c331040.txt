Description:

This map looks like Invasion in Skulltag. You are closed in 
a 1024x1024 square, and a lot of enemies attack you from all 
direction. You have to survive it for about 10 mins, then the 
exit will appear. Weapons, ammo, armor and recovery items are 
supplied in a fixed term. There is a heliport in the center 
of the map, so doom guy might wait rescue. I had felt this map 
was not difficult before I tried it, but it was harder than 
I had expected. My health gradually decrease by their attacks. 
I always managed to survive with low health just before a next 
supply. In the early stage, I didn't assail monsters actively 
and I only thought of survival. The first reason was that enemies 
couldn't enter to the player's field, excluding cacodemons. 
I therefore was never pushed to the wall. They gathered around 
a fence and fought against one another. The second reason was 
that I thought battles until the middle part didn't depend on 
a record. Teleport points of enemies are far from the player's 
field and the outside area is a little bumpy. They were often 
stuck on a wall, a object, or something and didn't come here 
easily. The last horde of enemies wrapped in about 8:00, but 
I could usually see all of them in over 10 mins. For such reasons, 
I regarded survival as very important, and behaviors of monsters 
in the last part greatly influenced a time. This record is still 
enough improvable but I don't want to try it again. I don't say 
I dislike this map, but repeating this long survival many times 
for a better time is a boring task.
