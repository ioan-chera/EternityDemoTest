Description:

This is the oddest map as the final map that I have ever seen. 
Before the map, I had answered it was map 30 in Kama Sutra. 
This map has many squares which moves up and down automatically, 
and there are over 100 arch-viles which teleport one by one in 
fixed term. The sky changes alternately just before a vile comes 
here. You push two switches by vile jumps, then a key appears 
next to a square which is player's start point. You can't get 
the key until the square rises completely once, then a stand 
where the key is placed moves with the square. A wall run sometimes 
can be used for pushing a switch in a Boom-based port. It's very 
important for a faster record. When you gather three keys, the 
rest of viles are killed by a crusher. After you open a door for 
the keys, you will see the shocking end. At first, I pushed two 
switches for a yellow key and killed a vile until the square rose 
completely, and I repeated it again for a red key. However, it was 
impossible to kill two cyber demons while the square went down and 
up one time. I could push all switches by four viles. I got 2:13 by 
this route after many tries, but I thought it was still improvable 
for 1 second. While I was trying it, I got to have several seconds 
until the fourth vile appeared after I killed the second cyber demon. 
I therefore fought against the second cyber demon while I was avoiding 
third vile's attacks, and I pushed the switch by it. It was a little 
difficult but I managed to get 2:08. However, I suddenly wondered 
if I can gather two keys while the square went down and up first 
time. Although it was very hard because much luck was necessary, 
it was definitely possible. I encountered the third vile when the 
second cyber demon almost died. I was able to improve much time 
and I was satisfied with it. I also included in the 2:13 and 2:08 demo.
