Description:

Hard map. There was a SSG after blue key's door, so I wanted 
to get it quickly. However, attacks of hitscanners usually 
took me terrible damage and I died frequently because I had 
no armor. Also, the 2nd secret was so tricky. You can't get 
it without a vile-jump. If a vile resurrect any monsters, 
getting the secret is more difficult. An arachnotron which is 
large size would especially obstruct a player. I was therefore 
careful about the positions where I should kill monsters.
