Description:


Well, it was much harder than I had expected. First of all, map 21 was 
very difficult to survive until I got a armor. Although I played it slowly 
and I didn't ignore hitscanners, unlike my map 21 run, I died there many 
times. Also, two secrets were so troublesome. Secondary, map 24 depended 
on luck. There was no completely safe place after I pushed a switch in 
a room with many barrels. The cyberdemon and an arch-vile were especially 
dangerous. A position where a enemy appeared for teleport was random and 
it was important where the vile appeared. It would have been best if the 
vile had been in the cyberdemon's field. Moreover, map 27 was tricky. 
Enemies in cages gradually shortened my health and it was almost unexpected 
and unavoidable. I died there three times, though one cause of this was 
that I overestimated the advantage of starting this map with SSG and BFG. 
Finally, map 28 was the most serious problem. The beginning part was 
extremely hard. I was killed easily by two viles if I had no luck. Also, 
enemies often fell to the outside area. I found out that a fallen enemy 
could be killed by blast damage of RL, but I would waste much time. When 
I saw a stuck revenants, I had a sense of foreboding. As a result, the 
revenants fell, but I was able to deal with it quickly. For such reasons, 
this episode was too difficult. I got a BFG in map 24 and it was so useful 
in the later maps of this episode. It was not for faster play but for safer 
play. Certainly I could get a faster record than each map on max by BFG, but 
I didn't afford to do it. 

Full max movie? I don't want to try it. Map 32 will depend on luck too 
much. This map didn't exhaust me in a single map run because I retried 
easily even if I died, but there is no sure way of surviving. It will 
be a serious hindrance of a full movie.
