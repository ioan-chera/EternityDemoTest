Description:

Well...this map was too small to fight against the cyber 
demon well. Even if I could avoid a missile, I couldn't 
avoid blast damage easily. The last battle depended on luck. 
Also, I often had a lot of trouble of the 1st vile. I was 
able to deal with 2nd vile. It's OK. This map as a whole 
was hard.
