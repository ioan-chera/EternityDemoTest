Description:

This was one of the most difficult map in this wad. 
I always had a lot of troubles of arch-viles and the 
cyberdemon which were placed in tricky positions. 
First of all, I ever couldn't move normally without 
killing two viles, and they weren't able to be killed 
easily. I consumed much time and I was defenseless 
against enemies from behind while I was dealing with 
them. Secondarily, this map's exit will open when you 
push the 6th switch. An arch-vile appears in the upper 
floor when the 2nd switch is pushed. The vile was not 
troublesome itself, but the vile revived a mancubus. 
It was often stuck on the lift and attacked me one-sidedly. 
I couldn't do anything. Auto aim didn't work and many 
demons surrounded the lift. Moreover, after the 5th 
switch, many monsters appeared and it was extremely hard. 
I couldn't move freely in the lower floor as far as the 
master mind was alive. In the upper floor, I had to do 
battle against cacodemons and revenants while I was paying 
attention to a vile's flame and the cyber's missile. I 
wanted to kill the vile preferentially, but cacodemons 
always obstructed me. I was completely confused by the cyber. 
Finally, this map has a defect. Enemies frequently fell 
to the outside area. It was impossible to do a correct max 
if it happened. I don't want to try this map on UV-Max again.
