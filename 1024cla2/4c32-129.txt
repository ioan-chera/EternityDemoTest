Description:

I frequently died readily, but this map itself was pretty short, 
so I was able to finish it many times in the short term. I can't 
decide this map was hard or easy, but I can just say this map was 
extremely chaotic. The most of all the enemies were dead by the 
time I found out when I had only to use a plasma rifle randomly. 
As strategy, I tried to kill three arch-viles preferentially and 
I aimed the cyber demon secondarily. After that, the rest of enemies 
would be only some revenants and some chaingunners in the cages. 
My first target was under 1:40, but it was gotten quickly. I therefore 
set the next target to under 1:30 and I managed to get it. It's so nice.
