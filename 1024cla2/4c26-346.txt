Description:

This map is nice for survival but not very fun as speedrunning. 
After I made a round of the whole map while I was gathering 
weapons, I was locked out to the outside area in about 30 
seconds. 4 pain elementals spew out lost souls without a break, 
lost souls prevent player's movement and shave off player's 
health. It was a very hard trap, and I usually died from it. 
If you push the switch in front of the exit, the exit will 
be open over 2 mins later. It was enough time for me to kill 
all enemies, though I actively attacked them with bringing 
about monster-infighting. The record of this map therefore 
was almost determined when I pushed the switch in front of 
the exit. However, the last battle until the exit was pretty 
difficult to survive. Certainly a blue armor and a soul sphere 
appeared after the outside trap, but I usually consumed them 
soon for killing two arch-viles quickly. There were already 
few recovery items. You have to move well for avoiding to be 
surrounded by enemies. By the way, two arachnotrons prevent 
cacodemons from entering the building for their size. I would 
have been checkmated if I had killed arachnotrons quickly.
