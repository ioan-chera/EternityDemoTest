Description:

Three areas each have atmosphere of episode 1, 2 and 3 
in Doom1 within only 1024x1024 square. It's so interesting 
idea. I like it. While I was trying episode 2 max movie, 
I was always able to beat the old record (3:33). I therefore 
made it, but it's not very good run yet. Below 3 mins would 
be nice, but killing two viles quickly in the third area 
would depend on luck.
