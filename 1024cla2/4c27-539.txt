Description:

There are many caged enemies around the map and in the 
center of the map. They aim you from all direction and 
so you can't avoid their attacks easily. I wanted to 
ignore enemies until I got a SSG, but a small map with 
a lot of monsters didn't allow me to do it well. I didn't 
kill caged imps in the center of the map early because 
revenants, hell knights, and an arch-vile would teleport 
if imps died, though imps were sometimes dead from monster-
infighting or something. At first I frequently failed in 
UV-Max for missing caged enemies and I felt it so difficult, 
but I got used to not miss them for many tries. This map 
therefore was hard as it's a later map of this wad, but 
it was not harder than I had expected as a result. However, 
some enemies occasionally didn't teleport and a run was 
completly ruined. It irritated me a little.
