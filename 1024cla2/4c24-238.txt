Description:

This map itself was not too hard, but several enemies were 
placed in too tricky positions. First of all, some enemies 
are very far from player's area. You can't hit them with 
rockets well and can't take them effective damage by hitscan 
weapons. Moreover, there are some cacodemons in the outside 
of player's area, and they were the most serious problem for 
a faster record. Cacodemons were blown off if they were 
taken any attacks. Even if I got a good result in the inside 
area for good behaviors of the cyberdemon, the run was frequently 
ruined by cacodemons. They wouldn't return rapidly if they 
were blown off to a distance, and it often happened by monster- 
infighting. In this run, all monsters' behaviors were very nice, 
but one BFG shot which was usually used for killing cacodemons 
remained. I should have used it, but it's small error. This is 
because there would have been an auto weapon change for under 
40 cells in the last area if I had used it.
