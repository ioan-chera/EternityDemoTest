Description:

After res key's door, a lift which moves up and down 
automatically starts. If you miss it one time, you will 
wait for over 10 seconds. You must take the lift well 
for a better time while you are fighting against enemies. 
It annoyed me considerably. An arch-vile in the last 
part was also trobluesome. A vile often resurrected 
tough enemies, like a mancubus or a baron. I was just 
lucky in this run.
