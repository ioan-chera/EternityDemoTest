Description:

This is one of the oddest maps in this wad. The other maps are 
map 30 and map 32. This map was very hard but pretty amazing. 
There are two soul spheres in the map and they were so helpful, 
but there is only one blue armor. You can't recover armor point 
again until a mega sphere in the last area if you get it. Although 
the blue armor could be gotten quickly after I started the map, 
I left it for the later half. However, the first half itself was 
not easy at all. This map has many arch-viles and they usually 
appear in tricky positions. I wasn't able to kill them easily 
because resurrected enemies and a uneven field often disturbed 
me. A vile in a cage after the switch with BFG especially had 
a lot of trouble. I was often bogged down by the vile when there 
were many corpses in the cage, and I wasted much time. I made 
effort not to leave corpses there, but monster-infighting was 
unavoidable. A red key and a soul sphere were placed in each 
square surrounded by many small crushers. I was not good at getting 
them because I grazed a crusher easily. I could usually escape 
from it even if I touched it, so I certainly rarely died, but 
the crusher's speed would slow down until it reached a floor. 
It was a fatal error for a better time. Moreover, I was blocked 
by demons and was killed by a crusher several times when I got 
out of a square. I could do it after I killed all demons, but 
I couldn't take them efficient damage into a square. In the last 
battle, it was very difficult for me to avoid the combination 
of fire balls and homing missiles. If I had killed only the boss, 
I would have aimed only the center of the boss and it would have 
been easy. However, I would finish this map without killing all 
enemies.
