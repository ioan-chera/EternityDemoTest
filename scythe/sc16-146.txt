  Description:
  5s improvement over psicho's run. I got better infighting at the graveyard,
  worse one in the church, but the archvile telefrag evened that out I guess.

  I got 1:48 very quickly and felt it was cheap. I clearly underestimated
  the infighting luck bestowed upon me, 'cause this one took hours of grind.
