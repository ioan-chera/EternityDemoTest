I spent quite a while playing this map. It's a lot of fun.

A very ugly start followed by a lot of luck at the first switch.
Later on a nasty delay getting stuck by a revenant after getting the yellow key.
Still room for improvement.
Also at the end maybe more can be done to take out the guys on the ledge above when
down below.

I watched Huy Pham, Krypto and Tatsurd-cacocacos demos a load of times to get the general
idea on how to play this map so main credit goes to them.

I started out using Doom2 (complevel 2), I have a 3:05 demo on this but kept having
demo sync issues so I ended up using complevel 9 (Boom).
It just so happens that this complevel also makes this map a hell of a lot easier
because the cybies can be knocked off the ledges easily and this saves you a lot of time.

To play the demo use:
prboom-plus.exe -complevel 9 -iwad doom2.wad -file scythe.wad -playdemo sc26uv249.lmp
