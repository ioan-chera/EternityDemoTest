Demo entry #62.

Description:

His Majesty ToD gladdened me with his fresh record for a stylish, dreadful,
cruel map located in the bowels of Hell. His result is far below Vile's classic
record (6:41), which i considered absolutely godly a few years ago.

Quickly I started working on my answer to ToD's demo, because I was thinking of
a modernized route which would break one more minute-barrier. My first survival
was 5:12. After many more hours of practicing the run and polishing my strategy,
I finally reached the exit for the second time, breaking the 5:00 mark with a
huge margin.

Despite totally shaky performance in the end, I won't improve this demo further,
unless ToD takes it back. It was the most painful of all my regular UV Max runs
(including the one for the dreaded MM2 MAP28). When playing with an aggressive
route, the monsters are scattered around unpredictably and it becomes very hard
to watch out for their heavy projectiles (which turn me into an invalid with one
hit from the back, because of zero armor). Of course, the cybers owned me a few
times as well, but they are relatively easy to handle if you strafe widely
enough to get out of the potential zone of rocket hits. Two barons and a vile
guarding the BFG killed me a lot more times.
