  Description: 
    
  This is a map that I recorded my 1st-ever tyson run on, it was quite hard for me to do
  a 6mins exit and then Angus gave me a good lesson with his 3mins improvement. :)
  Nowadays it was much easier for me to do this run, this could be maybe 5th exit, the 
  other ones were between 3:25-3:40. Many things could be faster here (revenant on crate
  and 1st archie usually goes better) but I am happy with the time anyway.
