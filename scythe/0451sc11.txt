Description:

My first time under 5 min, which is what
i wanted. There are some really bad moments
but well its a long run... ;)

Map11 -	I loved when nobody would cooperate
	in 10 or more attempts in a row.
Map12 -	Ok, 14 is also possible this way.
Map13 -	The red key grab would be nice ;)
Map14 - I love this map and usualy all went well
	here as i spent hours on it some months/years
	ago, trying the pacifist way...
Map15 - The pig here can be extremely annoying
	but this time it was more of my fault :/
Map16 - The rock climbing i managed, the blue key
	wasn't blocked, no archy bothered me so
	the very last one had to handle it all by himself..
Map17 - Ehm, here begin arch-jumps. I never did them before
	and i'm lame at doing them so every exit counts.
Map18 - Good mancubus...
Map19 - Arch-jumps, take two. At least he wasn't
	at all 'idle' this time. It's also shame
	i didn't get the invulnerability faster..
Map20 - Might be my best time here. The ending is excellent,
	i would like to say thanks to all who took part in it.
