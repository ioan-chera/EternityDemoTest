Description:

For years, I never got bored of speedrunning this memorable level. This time I
tried it Pacifist style, setting my target time below the current regular Speed
record (0:49 by Psichotic). Demo took me only a few hours in the night plus a
few minutes in the day. Unlike my other runs, the main difficulty here is not
to keep the health above zero, but to avoid getting stuck. The Doom marine is
fatter than he looks (at least a gazillion times fatter than I am in real life) 
and loves to get trapped in huge, huge gaps between soldiers, imps and
demons. It can be seen in the clumsy start of my run, but all other parts went
smoothly. In particular, the final army didn't disturb me at all :-)
