4shockblast:

MP BFG useless, and not a very fun run overall. There's just too much dependence on one player getting some key first, so the other one kinda has to sit around for a bit or not be as useful. Also, my route uses way too much chaingun, takes too long to get to a good weapon. Just wanted something where we don't get confused on the route, this isn't too bad. Hard to save too much time over SP here, though. My movement is sort of ugly here, but overall, the route went fine, so good enough. Sub-40 was really easy to clear, not sure what time this could be.

GarrettChan:

It takes quite a while to get our works sync up with each other. The MP BFG is at the end and it's not even helpful for the the whole run. Also, all those extra SSGs are, once again, traps for me since I don't even need it.

The terrible part for me is to snatch the RL and 2 rocket boxes near those 2 HKs since they can just corner you in.
