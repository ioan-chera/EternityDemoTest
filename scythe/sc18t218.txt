Comments: I knew I wouldn't get a satisfactory demo on this map.  There are just too many situations where luck is required. Infight luck, punching luck, telefrag luck, there is just too much that would have to go right to get a "good" time on this map.  I'll just settle for this 14-second improvement and move on. Maybe someone else will come up with a better route that provokes more infighting.
Also including a demo where I somehow get the glide perfectly, and I mean perfect...you'll see me stop in the middle of it out of shock.
