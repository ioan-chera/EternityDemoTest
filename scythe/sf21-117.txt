Comments:  I chose the safe way with taking the soulsphere,
           which is of course not necessary. The demo is
           ok. Missing the chaingun was not in my plan,
           but it caused better infights than usual.
           My shotgun aiming could be much better.

           I would be satisfied with a time under 1:10.

           Please have also a look at sf21-123 :)
