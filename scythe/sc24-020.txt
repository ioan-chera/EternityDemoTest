Description:
I've only seen this rocketjump trick in an old method's nomo lmp, so route credits go
to him :) But as i'm not that comfortable with prboom yet (used to play zdoom alot),
i decided to make it tool-assisted. Nothing much to say really, though making a good
jump to the key was a little bit tricky. And the second rocketjump is nice imho ;D
0:19 seems possible with a better running, but also needs some better cooperation from
hellknights.
