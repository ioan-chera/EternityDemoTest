Comments:  I wanted a short demo that I could use to (re-)figure out how the quickstart works in PrBoom+ (in this case, a fork or said port) and this fit the bill.

I found it remarkable how close ferfrancuito's NM Speed was close to a 2.xx (DSDA v3 erroneously lists it as 3.23; it's actually 3.03) and I wanted to see how close I could get on the correct complevel (ferfrancuito used -complevel 17/-1). Pretty close, as it turns out. We're only 4 tics away from a 2.xx!

Included is a -complevel 17 demo that reaches 2.91. It seems the arch-vile is more likely to target the player sooner on -complevel 9 or higher.
