Comments: Could be as fast as NM-Speed or even lower, but it's quite luck-based to get past the first half and the cyber, so I'm fine with 0:29. Got blocked quite a bit at the start here, and I think I spent too long to open the red door as well (also if you're very lucky, you can get a death slide from cyber into the exit).
