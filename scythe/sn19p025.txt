Comments: 
Got inspired watching Kristian's UV-Pacifist and felt like trying it on NM.  Yeah, it's nasty since there's so many ways for a run to become borked here.  Otherwise, the archie jumps after getting the invul. are easy to execute.

Pretty happy with the run.  Started with a crappy 0:28, worked that down to 0:26, thought that was good, but felt 0:25 was possible.  Kept at it until said run was recorded.

Run went fairly well I'd say, but there's lots o' bumping into monsters early on.  I wonder if 0:24 is possible here.

Oh, and my exact time was 0:25.91.  Joy :).

Credit goes to Kristian for the nifty little invul. sphere grab trick.
