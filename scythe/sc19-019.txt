Comments: Was randomly trying pacifist here, then randomly tried to do the RJ route with a thing boost and it worked. Guess I've done a fair number of such demos, so I decided I'd try and get a decent time. Good AV luck here, pretty thing boost luck, although it could of course be faster (possibly with an imp, but I found that harder to set up). Naturally also possible pacifist, but more annoying.
