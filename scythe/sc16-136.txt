Comments:
Watching vile's new map23 max inspired me to polish one run as well,
so I picked a map at random and joy! It's one with my own record.
I changed the order of a few tasks, mostly in hopes of using rocket
splash more efficiently. Lucking through all the unpredictable parts
still took some patience, like a decent infight on the cemetery
and the arch telefrag. And the exit archie flinching, haha.
