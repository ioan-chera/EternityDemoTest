Comments: Lazy 10 minute run. 10s is almost certainly possible with this wallrun strat, though you'd probably need good movement and a single-rocket kill on the spectre. Included an attempt where I fixed the section starting from the spectre rocket kill at the end with a rerecord that's a 11.00. Wanna try that, MCD? :D
