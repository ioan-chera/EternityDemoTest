Comments:

Firstly, many thanks to Jochen "Angus Thermopyle" Schneidau for 
providing the (much needed) inspiration for this run. I more or 
less copy his route, only I play the start just like in UV.

You'd be surprised how often I got away with doing the start 
like this. Of course, there's always the odd attempt where I'd 
get blasted to bits after only 2 or 3 seconds, but more often 
than not I was well into the "safe" range (>50% health) when 
having passed the 2 Arch-Viles. The blast after pressing the 
switch is intended to make them move out of my way, BTW.

This map is a pretty good example of why NM speed isn't as 
much fun as UV speed. Exits here were few and far between. :-(

I was nearly killed on the final staircase in this run (or 
at least blown off it), but somehow I survived, and could 
finish. At last.

sn29argh.lmp is the very definition of a Ronge style demo. 
Everything went great (I even had so much health I didn't 
have to use Jochen's somewhat risky blue armour grab, which 
was *very* rare), until ... well, just watch it. :-)
