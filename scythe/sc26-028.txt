Comments: 29s was easy and didn't take more than 20-30 mins or so, took a few 29s exits to get 28, though, mostly just luck with getting past the two cybers at the switch, the revs, and the monsters right before the exit. Fast exit would get an archvile jump or a double one, but it would be quite difficult
