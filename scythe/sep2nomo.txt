Well, I have quite a few comments. First, the levels and their
times. Then, I rate them from one * to five *****, five being
great and one crummy. ;)

MAP11: Sneak Peak (0:18) *****
Since there are no monsters, I have to use a different trick
than the death slide. This is probably the second fastest route
and I'm proud to have discovered it so quickly. :)

MAP12: Walk in the Park (0:17) ****1/2
Very good, could've grabbed the red key a little more
quickly...

MAP13: Subverted Base (0:31) ***1/2
I can never perform that stupid red key jump, but I make the
best of it by just doing it the normal way. The rest of the
run is OK, but I would prefer under 30 seconds.

MAP14: Power Outage (0:32) ***
Kind of a crap run. One of the only notable good things is
pressing the switch to gain access to the red key room early.

MAP15: Blood Bath (0:29) ***
I'm sure there's a way to take a huge shortcut, but I can't
ever seem to find/perform it. :(

MAP16: Burial Grounds (0:29) ****
Better. I'm glad I got under 0:30.

MAP17: Book Lords (0:32) ***1/2
OK, but I would like a time under 30 seconds...

MAP18: MS Futura (0:24) ***1/2
I mess up by grabbing the plasma rifle instead of the blue
key (silly me)! Oh well, I was able to press the switches
before the yellow and blue doors were all the way up, so I
count that as pretty good...

MAP19: (3000) AD (1:29) **1/2
Probably the crappiest run of all. I'm slow, and without 
monsters, there's really no good shortcut. To top it off,
I had crap luck with the moving platform in the blue key
door (stupid platform).

MAP20: The Starport (0:44) ***1/2
Another okey-dokey run, but I probably could've just
strafed right onto the blue key platform rather than
stopping and running onto it.

Total: 5:45 ****
OK run, I could improve, but second attempt. :)
