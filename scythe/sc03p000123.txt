THIS IS MY SIXTH ATTEMPT ON THIS LEVEL, THE KEY IS NOT SHOOTING AT ANY TIME, THAT WILL ALLOW YOU NOT ONLY TO 
SKIP THE TELEPORTING IMPS AND SHOTGUNNERS, BUT ALSO TO KEEP AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE YOUR HEALTH, EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE A BERSERK
MEDKIT, I RECOMMEND YOU TO SAVE IT IN CASE YOU ARE REALLY LOW ON HEALTH.
MY HEART ALMOST STOPPED AT THE END, SERIOUSLY, IF I HAD FALLEN OFF I WOULD HAD TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN, I DON'T THINK I 
WOULD HAVE SURVIVED THAT AMBUSH OF ENEMIES
