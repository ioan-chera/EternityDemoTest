Comments: I started NM100 attempts for ep 1 and on one attempt managed 11.3x on this map, so I figured I could do 10. Back when I did 11, I didn't think 10 was possible, but now it turns out it's not even that tight, as there's still points of improvement in this run. Hard to believe how bad I was back then. :D
