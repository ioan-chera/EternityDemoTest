Comments: Was fairly easy with this strat, still requires some luck, though, as pinkie doesn't always stay around the bars. Centisecond time could be pushed further down, but sub-3 is definitely not possible. I suppose it'd be possible to get this in UV maybe with an insane luck grind, but screw that. :D
