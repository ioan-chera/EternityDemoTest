           I did sp26-050 on my old comp, a P150, and playing
           this map was a bit laggy. Without lag now and with a
           better strategy to get past the cyberdemons I saved
           three seconds. Under 0:45 is possible with better
           running, more luck - and you don't need the first
           megasphere. Perhaps another day.
           It's still an exciting map :)
