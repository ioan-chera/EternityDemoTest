4shockblast:

This was quite frustrating but also pretty fun. :^) At the end, I didn't play super well and got trolled on picking up more ammo/health, so I was just trying to survive. Thankfully, we got all the kills we needed anyway. I guess now we have -fast, max, nomo, NM, and Stroller left to do on this map. :^)

GarrettChan:

Now we decided to wrap up each day with Scythe Map26 :^)

We decided to switch roles after the first "few" tries because 4shock was getting stuck way more often due to the start position placements.

I actually planned the MegaSpheres differently but sometimes you have to improvise I guess... I only need to go to the middle teleporter to trigger more monsters, but I went into another teleporter because I was cornered. Staying on the upper floor is actually super dangerous because there's only one stash of ammo and 1 MegaSphere left.

Crispy Doom's percentage display is different from DSDA-Doom, and it somehow shows less than 50% combined there. However the SP Respawn only took 2:17, so 1:41 should be enough... I guess it could be a bit shorter because we waited at the end but we have no way to tell. We just decided 1:40 should be long enough and took a blind shot at it.
