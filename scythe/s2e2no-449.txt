Well, I set out to improve my old run of Scythe 1 Episode 2.. again. Even
though I know I've improved a lot over my time, I still don't produce runs
that are that great. Crap. :)

Anyway, I don't know why I named the demo "s2e2no" since it's Scythe 1, but
apparently I had a brainfreeze. Just to be clear, play this back with THE
FIRST SCYTHE if you watch it.

Maps, times, and comments are below.

Scythe Episode 2:

MAP11 (Sneak Peak): 0:15
Comments: 15 is my PB.. I still insist on running this map this way since
I suck at deathslides. With this route, 14 is very possible, but I'm too
lazy to try it for an episode run.. maybe a single run I could do it.

Time from sep2nomo-455: 0:16

MAP12 (Walk in the Park): 0:14
Comments: GOSH DARN IT 14.00. >.<

Time from sep2nomo-455: 0:15

MAP13 (Subverted Base): 0:30
Comments: I can't seem to perform the RK keygrab no matter how many times
I try, so it's the long route here. 30 is all right, I guess.. 29 or 28
is better.

Time from sep2nomo-455: 0:31

MAP14 (Power Outage): 0:30
Comments: I really screwed this one up. Should be 28 or 27.

Time from sep2nomo-455: 0:28

MAP15 (Blood Bath): 0:11
Comments: 11 is good, but 10 would be a lot better.

Time from sep2nomo-455: 0:13

MAP16 (Burial Grounds): 0:26
Comments: Due to some clumsiness while keyboarding, I got a second slower
than what I wanted.

Time from sep2nomo-455: 0:27

MAP17 (Book Lords): 0:30
Comments: Another one, like MAP14, that should have been 28. I'd have
been ok with 29, but 30 is just... >.<

Time from sep2nomo-455: 0:31

MAP18 (MS Futura): 0:17
Comments: 17.09 really ticks me off. Would have been 16 without that 
wallbump at the start, and that glide is tough to perform really fast.

Time from sep2nomo-455: 0:16

MAP19 (3000 AD): 1:17
Comments: I'm actually happy with this one. Probably the best run in the
bunch. My only complaint is that I had to wait for the stupid perpetually
moving floor, but I can't exactly control when it moves. 

Time from sep2nomo-455: 1:20

MAP20 (The Starport): 0:39
Comments: I got a bit excited and messed up near the end with an ugly
wallbump. Ah well, it's at least under 40.

Time from sep2nomo-455: 0:39


TOTAL TIME: 4:49

I'm glad to see this under 4:50, but I know most other people would have
no problem getting this under 4:40 (maybe even under 4:30). Keep Dooming
fellow Doomers, and good luck to those who attempt this. I'm sick of trying
this again for now. :P
