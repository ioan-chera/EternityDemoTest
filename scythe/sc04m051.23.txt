Comments: Route credit goes to Kyle McAwesome, the current wr holder for this map. Another demo is included in the zip that was close to my pb. It 
felt like quite the rng grind, but that's just because I don't have a consistent plan for each section. Maybe I will revisit this map later, maybe 
when I get a lot better. Btw this is the first ever map I tried speedrunning. Feedback would be appreciated as I am only a beginner to this.
