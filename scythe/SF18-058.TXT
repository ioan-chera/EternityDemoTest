Demo entry #5.

Description:

Gusta is right, this level is really designed in the Duke3D style. I love it
even more than the previous 17 maps. A strong, atmospheric design, the buildings
and the crane look great. That majestic fire gate is one of the coolest objects
I ever saw.

My first demo with some Strafe50. A great fun action, it takes some luck to kill
everyone in time and avoid getting blasted. My plasma aiming inside the building
was not flawless, but other than that, the demo went OK.
