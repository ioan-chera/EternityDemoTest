I tried out that "dreaded" SR50 jump at the beginning to see if it was
possible without tools. It's really not that hard.

While practicing it, I exited in 16.74 (because I didn't grab RK on the
first try). After that, I knew I should start recording. Started at 1
a.m. (rofl) and I got this in 10 minutes. :P I didn't have to stay up
late fretting over this one. Nice break from another demo I'm working on.

This looks unpolished, primarily right after the jump since this is my
first time getting the jump after starting to record (once again 10 minutes
in is not bad). At the end I thought, oh noes, I'm gonna get 12, but it
was this, and I was so happy. :)

To improve this, mainly you have to get the jump better and not fumble 
around so much after. It's a bit luck-based, since you have to line yourself
up correctly quite quickly. Here I lined myself up quickly enough, but it
was at an angle where I bumped the wall after I made the jump. It's possible
not to have to do that at other angles. But it's 1:10 in the morning and
I'm a tired lazy Doomer who needs to go to bed. XD

Good luck to anybody who wants to get 10s. Shouldn't be hard once you
practice up and master the SR50 jump at the beginning.
