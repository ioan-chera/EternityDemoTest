Good way to start July. This was one of the maps I missed while redoing some
of my old Scythe nomonsters runs. Ironically, this was one of the easiest
to improve. I got 24.94 in 2 minutes. 23 proved to be a little more difficult
here, but nothing backbreaking. I bet Cacatou or Kyle gets 22 pretty soon
and sends it to DSDA.
