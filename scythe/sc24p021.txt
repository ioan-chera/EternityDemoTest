Comments: I had so much practice with these tricks in nomo/nomo movies that this wasn't too hard. After I practice the tricks a bit with rerecords with monsters, I got over my fear of the revenant crowd, and this became much more doable. :) Probably doing the tricks in a quicker way as in nomo and maybe really good luck with the crowd/AV at the end could yield a 20s run.
