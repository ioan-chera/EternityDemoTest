  Description: 
    
  Well it is a good map but the church part is such terrible...
  archie telefrag wasn't problem at all, it worked about 1/2,
  but I had many faster runs with 97 kills only. I never know where
  the last monster could be even I usually check out the catacombs 
  before going to the exit. In fact this was my only 100 kills
  demo...
