Comments   : I had a 2:39 false max because some of the revenants had not teleported in yet.  They arrived
             just before I was ready to leave in this run, which kinda caught me off guard for a moment,
             but better late than never.

             Also, I actually did encounter that spechits bug in this map when I flew right through
             one of the switches I was about to hit and all 9 of the cyberdemons on the high ledges had
             jumped down to chase after me. :P
