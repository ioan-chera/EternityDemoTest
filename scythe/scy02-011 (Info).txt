Comments: 
Yeah, of course 11 seemed impossible to me...because I wasn't using my brain and didn't think jumping to the exit platform from any angle was possible. 
I even said that jumping from the yellow door to the exit platform was impossible...without watching the record set by 4shock and remembering that SR50 exists.
I apologise for my dumbassery, here's the best run I've achieved so far without the use of SR50 because my current keyboard only allows two keystrokes at a time. Enjoy! :)
