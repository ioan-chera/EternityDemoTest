Comments:

I recorded this one a month ago. I remember thinking that I 
should aim for 0:31 (but when I got this 0:32 I was exhausted 
and it was time for bed). I never did get back to the run, 
and looking at it now it looks just fine to me (except for a 
moment near the end where I get blocked by the Cyberdemon), 
so I'll leave 0:31 and below to someone else.

Needless to say, this is a very difficult run, where you can 
get blocked by the Barons at the blue key, by any of the 
monsters down in the central area, by the Cyberdemon, and by 
the demons just after it. Oh, and you can get a rocket in 
your face easily, too. :-/

I recall using a *lot* of strafe50 here (I tried to use it 
whenever I could) but as you can see I'm not very good at 
controlled strafe50 running, so maybe I shouldn't have 
bothered. ;-)

Pacifist too.

Many many thanks to Erik for the route, inspiration, for 
making the map, and for making "Scythe"! :-)
