WAD: Scythe
MAP: MAP19: 3000 AD
Time: 1:17.77
Added Engine: prboom-plus v2.5.0.2
Category: nomonsters speed

After getting 1:18 in my complete nonTAS nomonsters run of Scythe, I knew
I could improve the time on this map for single level. I tried to run this
faster but couldn't, mainly getting bad luck from the perpetual lift rising
instead of lowering when I got behind the blue door. This demo also features
an unusual--not really, but close--bug around the 40 second mark where I'm
pressing the forward key and rubbing against only air. Explanation: I was
rubbing against the elevator earlier as it was coming down, then I stayed
like that when it was completely lowered to the floor.
