Comments: Dislike this jump because the AVJ is annoying, and also there's some annoyance with getting blocked by the hell knights all the time. I got blocked a bit in this run as well, but I managed to get past them (not sure how much time I lost). AVJ wasn't perfect either, I got stuck on the pews. :\ Didn't get blocked much at the end, though, so it ended up at my goal. 19 would be a good time, maybe 18 is possible.
