4shockblast:

1005 attempts total. I switched paths from the run we did with Dime because p3 is closer to the switch area, so it makes more sense for Kyle to go that way. However, I felt like I was contributing very little to the whole thing, so I switched the route up quite a bit. Eventually, I realized that the imp teles don't need to be triggered with RK, they can be triggered earlier, so I settled on coming in after Kyle, cleaning up a bit there, then helping with the imps, while Garrett grabs the RK from the bottom (cool that that's possible tbh). In the red building, I was focused on the zombie at the top of the stairs, and then killing the imp and pressing exit switch.

This demo went quite cleanly on all sides, and the time reflects that I think, we cleared the 11 second barrier by a good margin (previously we had two 11.03s as PBs). I think 9 is probably doable, but needs quite good luck, and not having Internet lag would help a lot.

GarrettChan:

One of the most intense run we've done. The route is nothing like we planned before, and we changed a lot of minor details while trying.

Going into the main building is definitely the movement heavy role that I can't take on, so I'm taking on the easier part of the whole map though it's still pretty annoying since the Zombiemen are random in the red building. I want to kill them before going in, but sometimes they just don't show up.

Wasted a bit of time when grabbing the Red Keycard, but with all the lags considered, it's not as bad. However, the run can be definitely better.

Kyle McAwesome:

Lag was our biggest enemy here, with the majority of runs restarting within the first couple of seconds.  It took us a while to finally settle on a route, but with this one we were regularly getting mid to late runs on the correct pace.  Then it was just a matter of grinding out shotgun RNG :^)
