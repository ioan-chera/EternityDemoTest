Comments: Not an interesting run, but I wanted to incorporate the map 24 tricks into a run and ended up spending much more time on this than I wanted to. It's still far from perfect, but I am tired of running this episode nomo, as it is just too boring even with the tricks. Maybe one day I'll come back to it.

Map 21 (0:09.71): Not the best looking 9, but I wouldn't be able to get 8 in an episode run.

Map 22 (0:20.66): At first I took 21s because the map 24 tricks would still guarantee that I'd get a faster run than my last episode run, but, eventually, 20 became easy enough that I reset the run on 21s.

Map 23 (0:22.94): 22 didn't happen every time, but it's pretty easy, even in an episode run. I still took 23s, though.

Map 24 (0:25.43): Got the tricks first try, but the RJ was slow, and the start had some bad movement, so I lost a second. Usually, I got 24s here, once I got 23s.

Map 25 (0:10.43): Messed up the key and lost a second. :/

Map 26 (0:21.89): 21 was pretty easy for me and happened most of the time.

Map 27 (0:09.97): I had trouble with this RJ despite finding it easy last time I ran this episode. Eventually, I figured it out and got good at it in practice, but in runs I'd always mess up my setups anyway. Here, I get a really good time, though, which is part of the reason I don't want to improve this run at the moment.

Map 28 (0:27.91): Nearly didn't get 27s with that bump, the fastest route here includes an RJ that is pretty easy but is one try only, so I didn't do it (it usually ended up in 25s on this map).

Map 29 (0:43.17): This was a trainwreck, worst-looking map in this run for sure. :(

Map 30 (0:32.94): Happy I was able to pull off a 32s even after the bumpy start. At least I managed to somewhat redeem myself after that map 29, heh.
