Comments:  Everytime you jump from a cave with a key and three Cybies, 80 new monsters will be
           released. On my previous run I teleported two times, here three times:
           80 more monsters ---> 9 seconds faster :)
           I also take the invulnerability at the teleporters first. It's hard to get this one,
           but after that it's very easy.

           Sorry about the 101%. If the mancubus hadn't blocked me, this would have been
           100% exactly :(
