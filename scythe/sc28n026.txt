Comments: Took about 5-10 minutes, my movement up to the demons is slowish (on fast runs I can hear the second set of zombiemen teleport in on the other side, here I didn't hear them, so they teleported in while I was rounding the corner). I had a bump and some sloppy corners, so maybe .2-.3 seconds lost. Good health, though, and no mistakes later on.
