The jump to the exit platform from the front is really not hard if you
use SR50 and angle yourself properly. However, many times I would bump
into the exit switch and fall into the Nukage after making it onto the
corner of the platform (bouncing off the switch). I needed to make the
jump more to the left of the switch so I wouldn't fall.

This is a quick 15 minute demo; really it could be 8, but I don't have
a great control setup for quickly turning 180º. I got 10.43 twice and
decided to keep playing; I knew it could be under 10. After that, I got
10.11 and then this.

Good luck to anybody who wants to try for 8, shouldn't be very hard and
probably 7 is doable too with excellent running. Enjoy!
