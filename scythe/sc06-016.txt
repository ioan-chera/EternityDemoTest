Description: 
This trick was done by 4shockblast in his nomo demo, sc06o010, 
which is done very quickly, and obviously also possible for UV-speed. So, while
the time is not perfect, this demo shows a consistent setup for this trick,
which can be used for episode\movie runs to save time.

This trick is very very precise when it comes to position, the smallest diviation
from the correct position will cause this to fail, though there might be other
consistent setups as well. I think it saves around 12 seconds if done instantly, 
but the main idea is that the expected time to get the right position and run across
is less than 12 seconds, so you will save time.
