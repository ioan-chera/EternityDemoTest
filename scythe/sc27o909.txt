Comments: Can't believe I forgot to look at the UV-Speed demos to realize that the RJ is unnecessary to do the jump here. The strafejump isn't too hard, but it's not that easy even with a setup, and, without a setup, it happens fairly rarely. .09 is the best I've done, and 8 looks really difficult, as there isn't much time left to save. I might be able to do it with an insane grind, but I don't want to try. All previous exits included (First RJ route, second RJ route, and quick strafe40 only old route demo done in 51 seconds).
