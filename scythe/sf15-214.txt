Comments:  First ok demo. Good RL fight against the revs.
           I play this map for three days now and won't stop here.
           A time around 2 minutes is my goal.
           This demo features a faster jump to the NW area with
           the plasma gun secret than Ryback's UV max record, so
           I'll try to beat that too.
           I also spent four hours with NM100S. The route includes
           two AV jumps. Had no luck so far.

           (Sorry for the weird moment in the imp corridor after
           about 1:50 - mouse problems again.)
