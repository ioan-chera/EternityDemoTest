Comments:  It's a nice run on UV, but on NM it's really
           nasty.

           At first the jump. I have much problems with
           it and make it only 1 time out of 8. Don't
           know how it really works, it always happens
           accidentally. Then the switch. I die there
           very often. The worst case is a spectre
           running upstairs :( The third nasty situation
           is reaching the stairs. It's pure luck to
           survive this. And finally there comes the
           jump a second time :/

           Nevertheless I did it four times in 0:25. All
           are looking ugly and have some mistakes.
           Strangely I missed the switch only once this
           evening, of course it happened in a successful
           run. You can see it here ... *sigh*

           I wanted it at least in 0:24, but four hours
           and several hundred tries are enough for this
           nasty - or cursed - run.

           On the other hand I'm of course happy that I've
           beaten the record by 5 seconds ;)
