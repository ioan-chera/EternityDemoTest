  Description: 
    
  Probably most boring demo I have recorded ever. Opening/closing
  door after getting blue key was the last way I wanted to use but
  I had to do it in this way. The direct impact into cauldron was
  the thing I really couldn't handle :)
  Ahh and I am playing without sound.. so I was badly surprised
  when last two revenants appeared at the and, soo little panic at
  that place :)
  Btw. This map also has one visplane..at SSG, it happened only once
