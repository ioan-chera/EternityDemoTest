Basically, take the first 3 secrets, use the invul to get to 2 other secrets and test your luck getting to the start and 
use the normal nm-speed route to exit. Start is the most deadly area, then comes that area with barons where you can get
attacked by cybers from 2 different directions, and also gotta worry about fatso balls and position yourself to do the
jump right.

I take mastermind way cause cybers + tons of cacos are usually blocking the hallway I used to go into this red area, mastermind
always kills me if I get there with low hp, and sometimes even with medium hp. Then I bfg spam my way to the spawn area while
quick getting a soulsphere. Once at spawn I can use the normal nm-speed route to exit the map, this time I somehow made it
with just enough cells to kill the romero head, even if I wasn't looking at ammo.
