Comments: Blah, two hours since I first got 0:32, when this clearly should have been 0:31...Just watch the ending! I also scored 0:30 twice with 1 missed kill, as well as a truly heartbreaking 0:29 with 1 missed kill.  This map is cursed on -fast.  I'm convinced there is no reliable way to approach that imp with the two zombies near the end.  So much luck required here just to survive, but to get a decent time is just blehh...
