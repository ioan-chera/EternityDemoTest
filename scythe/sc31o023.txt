Last summer mhrz was going for this and I decided to grind it a bit to test my movement skills and I was just way too slow, my PB back then was like 24.4 or something, maybe 24.2? I was using mouse sr/sl50 then though, and I've upgraded to kb sr/sl50 since, so I decided to try this again to see where my movement was at. I did not think I was capable of beating mhrz's time without mud for myself, so I decided I just wanted to grab 23 and see how much effort it was to regauge my movement, and I guess it's OK! I take a super wide arc in the tunnel before the exit doors, that looks so ugly, but I had a fine beginning and a super fast end I think. Tied confused's time on this :).
