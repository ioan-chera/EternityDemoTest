Comments: Short and sweet zero press. The way I performed this run is that I hold the 180 turn key on my quickstart, so I will be 
	  facing backwards on spawn. The reason why is because thats the direction where the exit switch is. I'm very bad at 
	  positioning my turning for zero presses and I take quite a long time, so I thought I could use the 180 key instead becuase
	  on spawn, doomguy faces the correct position to perform a zero press. Thats why you didn't see any turning. I only used my
	  horizontal strafe on my mouse. This is the strangest run I have ever done so far and my first zero press exit run as well.
