Description:

At first, I thought Romero can be killed by a cacodemon. However, 
caco's attack can't hit Romero easily. You can know about this 
if you watch failed demo which I included (sc30pfai.lmp).
To kill him would be easy if a lost soul came to Romero's room,
but cacos always came to there. I was only waiting until not a caco
but a lost soul appeared in Romero's room, and I managed to do it.
