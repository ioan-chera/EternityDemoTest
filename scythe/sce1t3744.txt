Comments: I'm sorry about this. This wasn't planned, I just did this for the Scythe Irontyson thingy in Doom General and idk how, I didn't just survive ep 1, I got to 32, and then beat my ep 1 time. I dunno what the fuck happened in my old demo, but based on the times, I must have played like absolute trash in the later maps, and all the time loss is there. It's extra annoying since I wasn't even going for time here, so I was meme waiting here and there while interacting with Twitch chat or remembering what to grab for next map, and for the lols, I got all the secrets too. :^) But a record is a record, and I hate to be hoarding stuff, so here it is.

I rerecorded the actual ep 1 to truncate to the first ten maps. My full attempt is contained in scythe_Irontyson_shock.lmp, and I added the Tyson -fast attempt that died on 4 as well just for fun (scythe_Irontysonfast_shock.lmp). Maybe I could have gotten further with -fast, but after doing this demo to 32, I was burned out so I didn't play that well, heh.
