Comments:  That was fun after some months without playing Doom. And easier
           as expected. I started with a 5:43 after 30 minutes and got a 4:30
           an hour later. Sadly this demo desyncs near the end, and all other
           successful attempts later on. It seems that the desyncing problems
           have to do with the crusher/teleporter. In all my faster
           exits I pressed the crusher switch while the second invulnerability 
           ran out. I tried glboom and other options (thx to Grazza for his
           suggestions ;) But had no luck. Finally I decided to return to my
           first setup.

           Even it is the slower route to press the switch as late as I did it
           here and to wait for the (few) remaining revenants (a bit luck is
           needed that all of them are crushed or teleported before exiting),
           this is much better than any desyncing demo. I hope I can improve
           this before Erik will finish Scythe II :)
