Description:
2 second improvement.

Only attempt to make it past map 22! (I died 2 times on 22 I think)
I will admit I got quite lucky here, map 23 and 29 arch-viles were really good.
I am lazy with resetting on map 21 and 22 with bad times so they are decent at most.
map 24 went ok, map 25 I didn't expect the shotgun pickup which cost me a second, not
sure if it cost me 2 seconds. I was supposed to pick it up on the start of map 24, but I forgot about it.
map 26 was bad, terrible start and not a good ending either.
map 27 the arch-vile cost me a second, still ok time, 28 was ok for me, 29 was very good and 30 a bit slow I guess.

Hopefully this will motivate 4shockblast to get under 4 minutes :)
