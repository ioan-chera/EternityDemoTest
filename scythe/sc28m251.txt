***Demonstrates a non-monster assisted linedef skip for the start.***

Comments: Credits for the setup go to PartyCrasher. He made a video on YouTube showing the setup, which was very helpful in the 
creation of this demo. Here is how the skip works:

1. clear out anything that can attack or damage you
2. get yourself wedged between part of the level geometry across from the linedef in mind. getting into the exact position is key
3. line up an angle on the wall with ssg
4. very very lightly tap w once. this is the part that makes the skip so easy to fail. i just eyeball it :P
5. if you felt like you tapped w for a tic or two too long, start from step 2 again, if not then proceed to step 6
6. now press all 4 keys needed for sr50 at once. you need perfect inputs
7. if you screwed up the sr50 like i did, start from step 2 again, if not then proceed to step 7
8. wait. don't let go of sr50.
9. pray that you didn't f up steps 4 or 6. if you did, then barrels will begin to explode off the map shortly after flying across 
the line. if not, then finish it!

This map has two linedefs that starts crushers over voodoo dolls. One is at the start which we skipped, the other is at the blue
gate (opens after hitting the blue switch). No need to skip the second line if you are swift enough. I am currently working on a
d2all uv max of scythe, that's why I made this practice demo.
