Comments:

i did exit room better than vita with little boost off zombiemen too. otherwise this wouldn't really be a 7 since i got
bars at 5.09

vita got bars at 4.91 so if you go off counting on that, you could only lose max 4 tics for 7.97 which means getting bars
at least 5.03 however i saved 2 tics in the exit room which allowed for 7.97 with bars as slow as 5.09, still i think i
could take it lower but i dont really need to, if you combine this exit room with 4.89 bars you could get as low as 7.77,
anyways second person to get 7 sec on sc01uv?
