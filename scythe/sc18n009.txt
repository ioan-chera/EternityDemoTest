Comments: Merry Christmas!  This was pretty hard for me to get.  A high percentage of runs you die attempting the glide (which in itself isn't very hard, only the surviving part), then you have to run passed the mastermind which also kills you a good percentage of the time.  Finally comes the hardest part, you have to make that jump with an angry nightmare mancubus firing directly at you, unless he happens to be distracted, which usually spells failure anyway because then he is blocking you generally.  There is no time to try and create infights, so you really have to just hope for the best with that manco and the arachnotrons.  Finally, if you make the jump, the mastermind usually kills you immediately after teleporting.  In fact, he does that for this run as well just see for yourself :P 0:07 is the time to aim for, but this will do for me.  Thanks dew for the route and glide advice.  Time is 9.97 btw.
