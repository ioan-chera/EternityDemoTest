Comments:  Tatsurd-cacocaco's run was used as the base.
           To save time I ignored revenants in the beginning.
           The run (active part) itself is very bad but it doesn't matter much,
           main skill here is luck. All cacos must be dead/distracted and
           at least one lost soul must survive (one is better, otherwise they
           would slowing each other while descending).
           Fourth exit, and this time lost soul was quite fast both in arriving
           and biting Romero. Surely time is easy to beat but it can be annoying.

           There is another, trickier but faster and much less chaotic route:
           to wake up one pain elemental in the pit with lots of cacos.
