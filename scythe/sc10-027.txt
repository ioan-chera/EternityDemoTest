Description:

When I played this map for NM-Speed, I found that barons 
can be killed by explosion of Romero's head. First, I intended
to kill only one baron with the explosion. This is because 
the baron in the second nearest the warp came to me while I was
fighting against two barons in the other side. However, I just 
noticed that the baron go to near the warp only occasionally. 
Therefore, I started to try to kill two barons with the explosion. 
However, two barons usually prevented me entering the warp, and 
I lost some seconds or died. In this run, I was able to enter 
the warp smoothly and get the good time.
