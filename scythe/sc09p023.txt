Fuck embedded buttons! This 1s improvement came much easier than on map05,
I've spent 45 minutes on it. Route credit to Angus, hopefully he won't mind
a lame 1s record theft after 7 years. :)
Faster times will need either smoother action on the button and the jump,
or borrowing some crazy moves from the TAS movies.
