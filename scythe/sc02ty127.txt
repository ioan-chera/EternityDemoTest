Description:
This map to grind isn't so bad as it is short, but the reasons why runs
die is why it's a bit infuriating. The zombiemen under the windows of the
yellow key room are basically just hoping to RNGesus that they miss you or
don't shoot at all. Otherwise, it isn't so bad, although this being my first
Tyson grind, I've realized how poor the hit detection is sometimes, or my
pistol being so inaccurate that it hurts me physically.
What I assume to be blockmap garbage, the zombiemen can be 2-shot in certain,
inconvienent spots but when you get up close they can stand up to 3, and that
really really sucks. The zombiemen on the vantage point inside the room are
also brutal if you tackle the room through the right door.
I've decided to do this reality too since I've seen the possibility, it's
not the fastest but I'm happy with having this so far.
