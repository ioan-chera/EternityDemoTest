comments: tried this yesterday, no exit, but i got my first exit after a bit of grinding today. not a bad time, but the main time losses are a slow ZP, not skipping green armour and also killing the BFG vile (you can run past him instead).
this run is pretty fun... apart from up to the yellow key. out of the 429 attempts i did, i think only about 15 got past the YK, and then 2 of those died past the yellow door :p
