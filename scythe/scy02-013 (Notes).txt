Comments: 
This was my first attempt at properly speedrunning a map and getting a good time on it so please go easy on me!
I feel like 12 seconds is possible, with a lot of luck and near-perfect movement but I don't know about 11 seconds. I don't think it's possible to jump the gap from the yellow
door to the exit platform. But hey, maybe I'll give it another go at some point! I'm happy with 13 seconds for now though. :)
