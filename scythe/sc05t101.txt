Joca64's 1:04 was pretty hard to beat, but then again 4shockblast's max is 11 seconds faster than this and doesn't have too much sg/cg usage.

Both cacos taking 3 punches was pretty good.  Punching luck was so-so in the spectre tunnel (one of them took 4 punches).  I also got stuck on the lift spectre somehow which was annoying and looks ugly.
