Comments:

It's easier to get good times in NM, because the Arch-Vile is 
always very cooperative. Sometimes a little *too* cooperative, 
though, as it is keen on killing you as you open that door. It 
happened regularly, and so I had to "hide" behind a corner 
temporarily to avoid getting fried. :-)

Didn't work long on this, I just wanted something quicker than 
the UV speedrun.
