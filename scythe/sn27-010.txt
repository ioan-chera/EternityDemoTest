The jump is a bit more difficult in NM than in UV, actually. 
The two demons (who can be very frustrating to run around, BTW) 
can easily block your jump, so you just have to hope they get 
hit by the imps or just run in another direction or something. :-)

The rest is about as easy as the UV run. Sometimes you get hit 
after having teleported (happened here), which may cause you 
to lose your direction slightly (happened here), but it's not 
a big problem.
