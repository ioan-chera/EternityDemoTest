Comments:

Jakub's 0:26 run was excellent, so making a substantial improvement 
is of course not possible. I toyed around with it a bit, getting a 
0:28 and then a 0:27. From out of the blue, after about half an hour 
I got a 0:25, which turned out to be 0:25.00. :-(((

Then, naturally I had to go for 0:24, and it came surprisingly 
quickly. Of course it's nowhere near perfect (and it's even a low 
0:24) but ... nah, I'm done. :-)

I'm including my two 0:25 exits, too (note the timestamps!).
Many thanks to Jakub Razak for the route and for inspiration.
