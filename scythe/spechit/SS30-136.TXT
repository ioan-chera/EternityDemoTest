Demo entry #162.

Description:

I just love Erik's harmonious mixing of urbanistic architecture and hell
(another bloody good example is his bldnight.wad). This famous map is really
interesting for NM100S. To push it below 100 seconds I chose a much more evil
route than in Ancalagon's superb demo, and many times those bastardic cybers
knocked me down from the ledge. But the result came quicker than I expected.
First exits were multiple 1:38s and 1:37s. The final attempt has some slowdowns
in the southernmost passage, but maybe they helped to prepare such a great
monster alignment and RNG behavior in the next few scenes :)
