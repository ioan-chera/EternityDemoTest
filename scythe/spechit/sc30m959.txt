This route had an insane amount of RNG that made it absolutely awful to get a run going. 
The biggest pain point was the cyber in the noble pen, it loved not shooting and it saves a lot of time getting it to infight.

Target time was anything under 10:30, so I'm extremely pleased with a 9:## time.

Imagine more yoloing on the snaking path for the red skull key could be faster, but I had enough garbage in this route.


Guess I should find something more consistent for when I look at d2alling this again :^)
