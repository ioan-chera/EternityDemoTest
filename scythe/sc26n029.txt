Comments: Close to 28 (.14), surprisingly enough, as it wasn't easy to get 29 even because of all the luck. Harder than UV because the cybers block me a lot more often, and same for the lost souls shot by the PEs at the start and the cacoswarm. Ending is still quite luck-based, so I'm not gonna improve this another second.
