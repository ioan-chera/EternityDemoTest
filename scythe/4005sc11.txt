I was aiming for a 39:xx, but this is probably the best I can do for a while. A sc21 would be impossible due to some of the extreme luck and memory needed for the later levels, especially level 28.

LV 11 -  Sneak Peak:
Yes, laugh at my crappy Tysoning skills. A certain revenant had taken too long to die here. Had crappy luck with the soulsphere secret. 

LV 12 – Walk In The Park:
Bit of a bad start with all the weird weapon management and all. 

LV 13 – Subverted Base
Oh god, the horrid memories of this level. I kind of took a beating on this level. But as always, I saved the soulsphere and armor to the end.

LV 14 – Power Outage
Had a problem with the Hell Knight on this level, so I had to shotgun him instead of rocketing him like usual.

LV 15 – Blood Bath
This level usually ends my run for me, because of a missed secret, or those two damned arch-viles at the end. Thankfully, that didn't happen here. :)

LV 31 – I Dunno Torn
I always thought to myself that I could strafe-50 over that teleport line and get that BFG, but it never happened. Oh well. We can all dream. The 2 arch-viles at the end gave me trouble.

LV 32 – Enoz Soahc
For some reason, this never ended my run due to the difficult ending. It just shows how much better I became. Back 1 ½ years ago, I only completed it 1/10 times. Now I can complete it any given time. Sadly, my fist couldn't be used, so I had to use my chainsaw to quicken fighting. :(

LV 16 – Burial Grounds
I love it how the megaarmor counts as a secret yet it's right out in the open. I probably could've telefragged the arch-vile, but I didn't want to risk damage.

LV 17 – Book Lords
Two runs ended here, one because of the arch-vile in the blue key room, and another one where I rocketed myself because my bro was distracting me by playing guitar. I'd usually blame him for my abrupt ends to my runs. :)

LV 18 – MS Futura
Short level. First appearance of the Spiderdemon, who really blows me away. So much so, that I wasn't able to get 200/200 health for the next level instead ending with 192/200 health.

LV 19 – 3000 AD
If somebody can please tell me where the person got the music for this level from, please tell me because I really like it. If it's original, I bless the person who composed it. Not really as hard level, actually.

LV 20 – The Starport
Final level, the only real challenge here is the cyberdemon, then everything is practically finished.
