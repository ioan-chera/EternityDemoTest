Woot :)!  Just felt a little unsatisfied with my 4:14, given some stupid mistakes that occured there.  Had to retry and see if it could be any better.  Well...how about 10 seconds better :)?  Pretty shocked, given that I was aiming for a low 4:1x or a high-ish 4:0x as my goal.

Really, the only glaring mistake is within the first 10 seconds of the run.  Lousy imp :P.  Perhaps dealing with the 2nd archie in the central area at the end was a bit sloppy too.

Other than that, everything else went swell, especially the elevator after opening the BK door.  I got some infighting to occur there when I finished dealing with the 2 HKs and Rev guarding a switch.  By the time I got around to the elevator...the imps somehow managed to off one of the revs and deal good dmg to the other one.  I had more than enough time to blow that rev away and SG out the rest of the imps long before the elevator finished rising...with me on it of course :P.

2nd half of the run went just fine I'd say.  No real hangups at all, other than that archie dealie I mentioned above.

Time-wise, quite happy with the time.  Perhaps sub-4 is possible?  Not for me right now though, as I'm satisfied with the run.  Gotta check out some other undone UV -fast runs.
