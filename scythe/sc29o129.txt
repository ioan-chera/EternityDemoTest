Heh, it's still 1:2x even though it's ugly in a few spots. I tried a bit, but couldn't do any better than this. SR40 only.

It might be possible to grab the YK without lowering the platform, but I'm bad at KG tricks so I don't know if it'd work or not. Oh well, this can still serve as a benchmark
if someone wants to try the long route (or if the YK grab isn't possible).

Enjoy!
