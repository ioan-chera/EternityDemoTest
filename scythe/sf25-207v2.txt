Comments: 
Call me stubborn, but I felt it could go even faster.  Same route, just played much more aggressively.

I feel bad for the cybie.  Poor fool got what was coming to him here xD.

MM/arach/caco area went very nicely here.

Rest is history as they say.

Time-wise, very happy with it. Only real glaring mistake I saw was hesitating too much after hitting the switch in the MM/arach/caco area.  Cost me a second I believe.

I'll settle with this for now.  Anyone very very determined could try to break 2 mins here, although you'd need some serious infighting luck for that to happen.
