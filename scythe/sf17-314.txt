Comments:  There are two critical moments.
           First: What happens after the red door? This went
           well here, with the exception that I've needed
           too much shots for the remaining imps.
           And second: The Archie at the soulsphere can be a
           pain. I always try to kill him as fast as possible,
           but the other monsters are in the way all the time.
           On the other hand the infights were helpful.

           Overall the demo isn't bad, but it could be much
           better. I want it under 3 minutes. Perhaps next
           week. I spent several hours with it this evening.
           And more than 200 tries are enough at the moment :)
