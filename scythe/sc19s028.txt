Comments: I was going through the Scythe nightmare tables, when I noticed this map didn't have any entries with 100% secrets.  This is probably because the standard nightmare route run grabs the invul in the secret without actually triggering it.  The fastest nightmare speed  demo is 0:24, so I decided I'd settle for a few seconds under 30 demo, since actually entering the secret takes a few extra seconds.  After recording this 0:28, I looked through the other nightmare entries and noticed that Method's Nightmare run gets 100% secrets as well, luckily his is a second slower :P
