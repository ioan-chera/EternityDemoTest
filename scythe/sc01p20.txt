IWAD: FREEDOOM PHASE 2

The map 1 of scythe is very easy, but even if it is easy, you have to be careful as usual, the three first building may be the most
"difficult part" of the map, especially if you aren't expecting the three imp trap. It's just a great introduction to the wad.

So, this is the first demo archive that I upload, I hope I named it correctly and that you have fun watching it.

I know that the time I made is not nearly the best, but I had fun playing, that's what doom is all about, fun, like any other game.
