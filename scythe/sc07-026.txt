Comments: Not too easy, biggest issues as Vile noted are the telefrags (particularly the last one as the mancubus I want to telefrag is usually uncooperative) and the arachs showing up at the end. This time, I had pretty good mancs as I didn't need to use any rockets beyond the ones I fired while running around the outside area, and the arachs were all on one side for some reason, which I've never seen before. As a result they almost got in the way of the RJ, but I managed to get good luck overall and get the 26.
