Comments:  Not bad, but a lot of mistakes in this demo.
           I did a 3:56 with one revenant left some hours ago,
           so I want a time under 4 minutes.
           
           BTW. I did about 15 exits this evening, and none of
           those demos desyncs (incl two with an MMH of 1, that
           was nice ;). I'm not longer sure if the
           strategy to press the crusher switch as early as
           possible would be much faster.
