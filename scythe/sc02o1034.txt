Comments:       The SR50 to the exit switch feels stupidly inconsistent
                even when I think I nail it. 90% of my attempts ended in
                me falling into the nukage no matter how sure I was I'd
                be able to clear the gap. Might be able to do a sub-10s
                one of these days.
