Demo entry #7.

Description:

My first released Tyson demo. It has some ugly slowdowns, but demonstrates an
effective route which knocked so much from Gusta's time.

BTW, I really recommend watching his 4:37 demo for another wonderful level, 17.
Brave and masterful performance, with exciting dramatic ending.
