Comments:

A very awkward initial trick jump (strafe-50 only, to make it worse). 
It took me many attempts to get this 0:09 run, mostly because most 
of my good attempts were spoiled by the Mancubus. It kept blocking my 
path. :-(

Method did a fine NM run in 0:09 of this map, but I didn't see any 
publicly released 0:09 run in UV, so I guess this is the first. :-)

Of course 0:08 would be an unbeatable time here. I'm very satisfied 
with this, though. Especially since this also is Reality, Pacifist, 
and Lemmings!
