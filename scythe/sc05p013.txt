Sweet victory at last! Adam Hegyi's demos are the strongest in the demopack, imo,
so I knew beating his time would turn into a horrible grind, but I didn't expect
the intensive burning frustration of it.

I got my first 14s pacifist exit after 30 minutes, then went on for like 5 hours
before I finally lucked out this one. The sewer spectres and the chaingunner just
wreck any successful run by body blocking and there's very little to do about it.
I also got a 13 where I fired a provocation shot and it somehow hit the chainer.
I cursed Erik the whole time... and method too, for making the exit fakeout look
easy in sp05-017. :)
