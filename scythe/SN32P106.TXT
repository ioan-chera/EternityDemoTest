Demo entry #108.

Description:

It's the only Scythe level which wasn't conquered on skill 5 in the far past,
but I found it easy. The best way to escape it with a good time is the silent
approach, so my Nightmare tablefiller is also a Pacifist run.

I reached the exit twice, and it took only 2 hours of bleeding. First survival
was 1:07, but I wanted it below Angus' UV Speed record (even though the two
switch-guarding hordes are a lot harder to lure out on NM). In this demo I
fumbled the yellow bar and the following door, but on the other hand, the second
horde accepted my mad rush past it, so the time is not bad.
