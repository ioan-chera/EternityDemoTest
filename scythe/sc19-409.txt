Comments:  I watched Vile's run, and while it was, as usual, flawless playing, I couldn't help but think the route wasn't as good as it could be - lots of infighting options that weren't used. Here's my go at it, and while it's only a 9 second improvement, and is using a port rather than Doom2.exe, I am very clumsy compared to Vile so a good player using the same route would most likely manage under 4 minutes.
