comments: over 3 and a half thousand attempts, this run is absolutely messed up. if i ran this any longer, my keyboard probably would no longer be with us. this run was a mistake
the lowest i think it could go is 7.8, but still doubt if anyone will get that on their first 7 or bother grinding for it...
thanks to 4shock for making me run this utterly rubbish map :stirred:
