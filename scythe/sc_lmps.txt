The DSF Scythe Multi-Skill! lmp collection
------------------------------------------

Recorded by Erik Alm, Casey "Altima_Mantoid" Alvis, Angus_Thermopyle,

This is a collection of recorded demos (lmps) for all 32 levels of
Scythe. All levels were completed on skill 4 (UV) with 100% kills 
and 100% secrets, where possible.

But not only that, we've also included a collection of speedrun 
demos, one for each level (and sometimes more than one!). These 
demos just blaze through the level as fast as possible, using
all manner of tricks. Trust us - you WILL be amazed :)

But not only *that*, we've also included a collection of NightMare!
skill demos. While it didn't prove possible to finish the 
whole set on NightMare skill, we've still managed to put 
together a set of 25 demos. Most of these are nearly as fast
as the UV speedruns...

That's *ninety three* demos in all. You won't be bored :)

To playback these demos, put them in your doom2 directory and type:

        doom2 -file scythe.wad -playdemo sc??-uv     (maxkill demo)
        doom2 -file scythe.wad -playdemo sc??-sp     (speedrun demo)
        doom2 -file scythe.wad -playdemo sc??-nm     (nightmare demo)

where ?? is the level number.

General Pack Comments
---------------------

Drew "stx-Vile" DeVore
----------------------
I feel honored to have been part of the beta-test team for 
this megawad and have also become a fan of Erik's mapping.  
It was my first time as a tester so it was interesting to 
see a megawad gradually take shape, sometimes in unexpected 
fashions (I didn't think Erik would make the Hell episode 
as difficult as it was, or as large in the later maps).  He 
did some truly amazing work, churning out several maps in 
the same day and barely having to tweak them to achieve the 
level of quality present in the final wad.  It also grabbed 
the attention of quite a few recorders, so the player 
roster here is about as varied as that of the TVR demopack.  
Enjoy the demos!


Erik Alm
--------
I am very happy about all the demo action on my wad. I have 
always wanted to make a megawad of my own and I am glad 
that I finally pulled it off despite my extremely low 
inspiration and motivation towards the end. Some really 
good demos in this pack, I especially like Vile's maxes of 
the ep3 maps, but all demos are nice really. Thanks to all 
the players for playing and for your nice comments. Special 
thanks to Vile and QWERTY for their excellent comments 
during betatesting.


Adolf "Gusta" Vodja
-------------------
Scythe is an excellent megawad full of short and action-packed 
levels. It offers such a perfect gameplay for every kind of 
single doomer: maxkillers will find there a lot of action, 
monsters´ traps and interesting newly incoming map ideas like 
map 28. There are hidden also many tricks and shortcuts for 
speedrunners. So as a result, Scythe is perfect stuff for all 
Compet-N players and I am glad I could do some contribution for 
it even if I had had just a very little of time to play. Finally 
thanks to Erik Alm for creating this megawad and and to all people 
who made such an interesting demos for it.


Angus_Thermopyle
----------------
I love Scythe. It has a lot of great maps with cool ideas and unique 
atmosphere, and some nice challenges (Map30: I have never made it through 
it, but luckily there is a stx-vile). 
But the main reason to play Scythe is its awesome playability. So much 
fun I have only with Doom, Doom2, Plutonia and Alien Vendetta. Great 
job, Erik (and Torn :) 

And, hey, you made Adam Hegyi to record some stuff :)


Casey "Altima_Mantoid" Alvis
----------------------------
Scythe is GREAT!! I had a lot of fun playing through it. Amazing how 
playable all of these maps are! I liked the idea of making you start 
from scratch every 10 maps with fresh weapons. The maps are all small, 
fun maps, each with their own unique atmosphere. Congrats to Erik for 
making one of the best Megawads I have EVER played!


Michael "OgreSlayeR" Lastovica
------------------------------
This is a really great megawad. I have enjoyed it and can see some very
good demos for it in the future even better than the ones out there right
now. Thanks to Erik for this great megawad.


Doug "Opulent" Merrill
----------------------
Erik is a mapping god.  It is nice to have a demoset that is
designed for speedrunners.  Short, fun playable maps that are fun for
every type of player.  I'm really happy to see so many great players
join in on this demoset.


Adam Hegyi
----------
Scythe got a warm welcome from the speedrunning community - and
rightly so. The maps are diverse and great for both the runs
and maxkills. The difficulty is nicely tuned, just about right.
I had great fun playing this set. I hope you like the demos :)


Radek Pecka
-----------
I gotta say I had a lot of fun playing Scythe. It was a great idea
to make this wad. It's a really good change to play these small maps,
don't have to learn complicated routes or whatever, just enjoy the
maps. What else can I say? Don't waste your time reading this, better
go and play it! Scythe simply rocks.


Chris "Ryback" Ratcliff
-----------------------
I think Scythe is pretty unique really - there's never been a megawad
before so superbly optimised for Compet-N style demos. And all the
players in this pack have needed no invitation to take advantage 
of this opportunity, hence all the demos you have before you :)
Scythe rocks for speedrunning, and most of the best demos are 
in that category - but the small, tight levels make for some 
very optimised maxkill runs as well. And as much as I think you'll 
enjoy watching this demoset, Scythe is even better when you
play through it for yourself :)

    third is a tool-assisted demo using the same trick that
    achieves 100% kills. See the level description :)

Descriptions
------------

The descriptions were written by the team member who recorded the map.


SC-01 - Get Going! (Radek)
--------------------------
A good map for the start, just grab the chainsaw and get mad. This demo 
took me probably the most of time, around 2-3 hours. Doing 28s is easy,
27s is hard. The biggest problem was to kill both Zobies by the barrel.
At the end I'm satisfied with the result.


SC-02 - Punchline (Radek)
-------------------------
I wasn't very happy about picking up Invisibility and going punching,
but you have to do it to complete all secrets. It's a tyson action all
the way to the exit. I didn't spend much time on this, so the demo could've
looked much better.


SC-03 - Up and Around (Angus)
-----------------------------
Compact maps like this one belong to my favourites, so I played it about 
a week constantly (with a bit sleep for a change) in different categories. 
You can learn here how to play tyson.

My max run is ok. I did some weird movements in the imp-cage-room, because 
I didn't notice that I killed two sergeants with one shot, so I waited 
for the third one teleporting in, but he had made it through yet. The 
architecture reminds me of "Redemption" (TNT Map10, one of the few 
better Evilution-maps).


SC-04 - Lost Warehouse (Radek)
------------------------------
I didn't kill the spectres very quick, but the rest of the demo looks
ok to me.


SC-05 - Slimy Tunnels (Altima)
------------------------------
This was probably my favorite map that I played for the demopack. Awesome 
and fun map, I spent maybe an hour or two to get the time I did. I like 
the map layout as well. As I said, this is probably one of my favorite 
maps that I had the priveledge of playing, and this is my hardest worked 
demo in the demopack for that very reason ^_^


SC-06 - Pressure Point (Altima)
-------------------------------
This map, although it is fun, it gets a bit luck-based for Max-Kill 
playing. The best thing to do is to crush the Hell Knights, but that 
doesn't always work like you hope =P It's great in design, and the 
last room is really cool! It's still fun to play, just like Scythe 
is ;)


SC-07 - Deadly (Adam)
---------------------
This is an interesting map to tackle in Max, and a tough
one too if you're going for a fast time. I figured out
the possibility of telefragging right away, then Angus
suggested that you can hit two mancubi with one stone
here. Needs a bit of luck though. The rest depends on
arachno movement mostly, they can be tricky to catch.


SC-08 - Garden Base (Gusta)
---------------------------
Very interesting map for maxkill. I have tried to do it as fast as 
possible but .. at least I didn't made any big mistake in this demo. 


SC-09 - Computer Storage (Ryback)
---------------------------------
Whoops, completely screwed up the ending :) This is a very well thought
out level, with a nice progression of weapons and enemies, except
for one point - the Mancubus on a narrow ledge and no easy way to
kill him, which forces you to halt, change weapons and hope every
rocket hits home. Otherwise, I quite liked the way your generic Ep1 base
area is extended by a detailed, non-trivial outdoor section.


SC-10 - The Lords (Radek)
-------------------------
It shouldn't be much harder to do it without the green armor. As you see
I picked it up anyway, and due to my blunt movements nearly died. I wasted
lot of rockets, more than was needed to kill all the monsters. I'd like
to see AdamH making a perfect demo here. 


SC-11 - Sneak Peak (Gusta)
---------------------------
Very nice planned map a little bit challenging for me though. I tried 
to play not too cautiously in the lava cave which is the hardest part 
of the map. However I have been dying there alot mostly by my own 
rockets. I would appreciate more place to move there. 


SC-12 - Walk in the Park (Ryback)
---------------------------------
I'm amazed I was allowed to keep this one, it's so messy (and
please shut your eyes at the end :) But that's probably the key to
a good time on this level - just hurl yourself in there, get all
the monsters together, and if you survive they'll go down nice
and fast. Very good use of light levels here.


SC-13 - Subverted Base (Opulent)
--------------------------------
I can't believe no one whomped on this demo... certainly nothing
spectacular.


SC-14 - Power Outage (Radek)
----------------------------
This was a challange. I started with times around 1:10, which wasn't 
obviously what I was going for. With some more risky playing got 1:01
after 30mins of playing, then I just coulnd't stop myself. 56s is the
best I can get. Btw. I like this map a lot, it's a very good action.
 

SC-15 - Blood Bath (Ryback)
---------------------------
Brilliantly fast, slaughterlicious (is that a word?) map. My target
was a sub-2min demo, which took maybe an hour to get. My punching
isn't very cool, but the rest goes well. That jump to the secret exit
area can be hard to execute...


SC-16 - Burial Grounds (Ryback)
-------------------------------
Nicely designed level, though the gameplay is a little lacking -
it's more a 'let's try to build something realistic looking' level.
The outdoor area probably needs something a little more to do,
and I'm always at a loss as to how to play the church. If you're
lucky you can telefrag the Archie and save lots of cells, but
I'm not lucky :)


SC-17 - Book Lords (Ryback)
---------------------------
Quite an addictive level, I'm a little sorry I never had time
to improve this one. Great fun to run around in nomonsters.
Hard only at the start, after you pick up the rocket launcher
it's party time.


SC-18 - M/S Futura (Gusta)
--------------------------
Great map! The whole design reminds me some of Duke3D maps I 
guess. Some luck is needed for infights and end MM telefrag. 
Another infight spider vs. 1st hellknight could save another 
10 seconds IMO. Didn't have luck with this one since I realized 
I should go for it. All in all thanks to Erik for this map and 
for his previous demo.


SC-19 - 3000 AD (Vile)
----------------------
Maps are starting to take longer to complete and it's 
almost time to say goodbye to the unique brand of techbase 
that Erik designed for this wad.  The ammo count and 
monster layout is just perfect and the architecture does 
wonders for the futuristic atmosphere.  The demo turned out 
well enough, but with more fortunate attempts I would have 
tried to take the automatic elevator up to the blue door on 
the first try rather than lose time waiting.


SC-20 - The Starport (Ryback)
-----------------------------
Vrack-inspired visual design, but the gameplay is a little messy here.
Kind of struggling here to say anything else about the level :)
Not one of the classics.


SC-21 - Solitude (Radek)
------------------------
Oh, this map is a killer. I had like 2 or 3 exits. I tried to do the
tyson part as safely as it can go, but mostly finished with low health.
And then, Pain elemental waiting for you. It's not the best idea to 
rocket it, really, but you have no choice. The Lost souls killed me many
times. Expect lot of dying if you want to beat this. ;)


SC-22 - Despair (Opulent)
-------------------------
good, short map; Erik really makes the most of the relatively
few sectors in there.  A good demo would race to bfg the baron/2 hks 
and let the Cyberdemon clean up... a TAS run would be well under 
2 minutes. ...now onto Map23 and a real demo!  :)


SC-23 - Anger (Vile)
--------------------
The map originally had you teleporting onto a barrel at the 
start so the resulting explosion would take away a good 
portion of your health, though in some ports this action 
would always end up killing you instead, so the idea was 
nixed.  This one is pretty tough to speed effectively since 
grouping monsters to maximize BFG damage is important, as 
well as using the cyberdemons to infight with the 
teleporting monsters.  A couple of chip shots with the SSG 
annoyed me, but this time I also had good luck with the BFG 
shots.


SC-24 - Hatred (Erik)
---------------------
One of the maps I really like myself, a lot of fun to be 
had with both max and speed here. Demo isn't optimized at 
all, I hope to see a better one at the DSDA sometime *hint 
hint*.


SC-25 - Envy (Ryback)
---------------------
Short level, optimised for BFG and rockets. Great solid design,
the ammo is just about perfectly balanced - not enough cells so it
becomes easy, just enough rockets that you don't need the SSG if
you play well enough. Infights help a lot here to distract the
larger monsters so you can kill them quickly.


SC-26 - Fear (Ryback)
---------------------
An excellent monster blaster level, just grab the BFG, some cells,
and go for it. Plus the level looks good even without monsters,
something most level authors forget to ensure when they make these
sorts of levels.

The key to a good time on this level is to snatch all three keys quickly,
then hit the switch by the Archvile. This activates a crusher trap
that kills all the revenants that teleport in, and since this unusually
designed teleporter usually takes at least six minutes to empty, this
cuts off a lot of time.


SC-27 - Terror (Vile)
---------------------
A rough map, especially the end encounter with the triple 
cyberdemon threat and the invisibility that you must fight 
with (something I've never been forced to do before).  
Gotta applaud the ingenuity of that approach, though 
sometimes strafing perfectly into a rocket was met with 
cursing, hehe.  There's lots of backtracking between old 
areas, which is usually a bane to players, but Erik kept it 
interesting by introducing new fights each time.


SC-28 - Run From It (Vile)
--------------------------
Not a map designed for max, but we have a few runs for it 
regardless.  I picked the approach that kills all reachable 
monsters, leaving some that haven't been killed yet by the 
"teleporting monster gibs" effect that Erik employed here.  
These particular monsters get killed AFTER the voodoo doll 
has been crushed, so you get killed before they do.  This 
style isn't particularly tricky until the very end... that 
final BFG shot has to hit the distant chaingunner while 
catching the 2 chainers and spider in the BFG tracers.  
This was my first run where it worked as planned, and 
that's all I had the patience for. :)

SC-28 - Run From It (Adam)
--------------------------
I figured these out after I saw Vile's demo. I'm really
not sure if this map was ever designed for Max, but
as I demonstrated in the TAS demo 100% kills is achievable.
It is really really tricky though as I spent a lot of
time even in TAS just to get the last kill. If you watch
with headphones on you'll notice how close it is before
I exit. I also did a much easier one with 95% kills. Actually
in this one the voodoo doll is making the slide possible.
With a normal corpse the CG'er would have no reason to fire
at ya.


SC-29 - Hell on Earth (Ryback)
------------------------------
We're at level 29, and here's the first big level :) The setting
is some kind of abandoned city in the ice, with Cyberdemons roaming
around outdoors and Archies in sniper positions. Health is tight early
on, but after picking up the BFG you're on easy street. You do need
some skill at BFGing Cybers at close range though... A good mix
of styles, plenty of maneuvering room, and this would have to be one
of the least confusing city levels ever designed.


SC-30 - Fire and Ice (Vile)
---------------------------
Oof, this map was tough... possibly the toughest max run 
I've ever tried and also one of the trickiest to find a 
suitable strategy for.  It's quite a challenge to defend 
yourself from the many directions this map attacks you and 
safe havens aren't available until some start areas have 
been cleaned out.  There's also not enough ammo to make it 
a simple BFG blastathon, like H232, so the cyberdemons have 
to be used for extra damage.  This demo can be boring while 
putting this plan into action, but I tried to make up for 
it elsewhere.  At the end of it all lies the source of all 
the evil previously exterminated by our faithful marine 
hero... the dreaded romero head.  Unfortunately he's a bit 
exhausted and can't expel any more demons, so put him out 
of his misery. :)


SC-31 - I Dunno Torn (Altima)
-----------------------------
I promised Torn that I'd record a demo for this map, and so I did =P 
Ryback's demo was good, and his is cooler than mine...after all, he 
does a nice long-distance Arch-Vile jump arcoss that BIG gap to get 
the Plasma Rifle...but my way is the way that was planned to get to 
that weapon ^_^


SC-32 - Enoz Soahc (Erik)
-------------------------
Just a shitty ripoff of adam windsor's excellent chaos zone 
(requiem map25), it's all made from scratch though, no evil 
copy paste action. Gameplay here is sub-par, just a few 
rooms crammed with enemies. Demo is decent I guess, nothing 
too thrilling.

Descriptions
------------

The descriptions were written by the team member who recorded the map.


SC-01 - Get Going! (DevastatioN)
--------------------------------
Small level, get stuck a couple of times here but it's a easy
speedrun.


SC-02 - Punchline (Adam)
------------------------
The trick in this one is pretty straightforward, but hard to
do because of the baddies blocking the way. I did eight in
nomo so I guess that would be possible.


SC-03 - Up and Around (Angus)
-----------------------------
I played this in pacifist-style because of the teleporting demons. 
They would be very successful in blocking the way to the blue 
key. I don't know if shooting here and there would be helpful, 
apart from that you have to get a shotgun first. I haven't tried it.
Very nice map :) 


SC-04 - Lost Warehouse (OgreSlayeR)
----------------------------------
Okay run. Kinda sloppy at some parts. Some demons got in my way and
cost me some time.


SC-05 - Slimy Tunnels (Adam)
----------------------------
One of my first demos. Nice speedrun, I liked playing this
map.


SC-06 - Pressure Point (Adam)
-----------------------------
This one is almost like -nomonsters. I got close to 23 though
I only aimed for 24. The last room is the only tricky part.


SC-07 - Deadly (Adam)
---------------------
What can I say, obvious trick here, and even the RL is unneeded
as was shown by Gusta.


SC-08 - Garden Base (Gusta)
---------------------------
Yeah, Erik, I did that jump in map08 even with my different 
Strafe50 direction than the others have. (Which is in my sight in 
the demo harder than if I would jump to the other side I guess) 
10 is surely not optimal. Maybe 0:08 would be perfect..


SC-09 - Computer Storage (Erik)
-------------------------------
Very obvious jump out of the window here. Messy demo, but kinda 
hard with so many critters to get stuck on.


SC-10 - The Lords (Adam)
------------------------
Very straightforward and easy. I tried a while for 11 but didn't
get anywhere with it.


SC-11 - Sneak Peak (Adam)
-------------------------
This is mostly luck. NM would be much easier but that was already
done ;)


SC-12 - Walk in the Park (Adam)
-------------------------------
The imp around the red key is a major headache, apart from that -
no problem. Quite improvable.


SC-13 - Subverted Base (Radek)
------------------------------
Angus' demo wasn't bad, but I wanted to speed some things up. This is my
3rd exit, so further improvement should be easy.


SC-14 - Power Outage (Ryback)
-----------------------------
You can lose a lot of health very quickly here :) I'm sure that if you
have an incredible amount of luck the monsters will all get out of
your way, but I didn't want to play this level THAT long, so I make a
couple of detours to take medkits and supercharge.


SC-15 - Blood Bath (Adam)
-------------------------
Very nice map for running. I had a different combination the first
time but I was shown a faster route, hence this run.


SC-15 - Blood Bath - Secret Exit (Vile)
---------------------------------------
A run mostly demonstrating the teleport design of the level 
also doubling as substantial shortcut design, but hey, it's 
a small level, and it only relies on running which is quite 
nice. :)


SC-16 - Burial Grounds (Opulent)
--------------------------------
49 seconds of pure boredom.  Probably the worst demo in this
demoset.  That's what you get for not beating it!  :)


SC-17 - Book Lords (Erik)
-------------------------
Easy map when the teleporting guys don't wake up hehe. 


SC-18 - M/S Futura (Adam)
-------------------------
The mancubus is somewhat annoying, otherwise easy run.


SC-19 - 3000 AD (Ryback)
------------------------
I followed Erik's nightmare route, which uses two Archvile jumps
to make a speedy path to the exit. There's an invuln en route,
and it's a ridiculously simple speedrun - the only problem is
getting the Archie to *quickly* go after you. I was fairly
lucky with this one...


SC-20 - The Starport (Ryback)
-----------------------------
This level is not built well for speedrunning at all, unusually.
I take the supercharge early to survive the close encounters
with all those monsters. The jump to the blue key isn't blocked,
and everything goes speedily from then on - somehow I avoid being
skewered by the Cyber :)


SC-21 - Solitude (Adam)
-----------------------
The arch-vile is more than keen to fry your ass here. Good slalom
anyways ;)


SC-22 - Despair (Erik)
----------------------
Not a very speed friendly map, but I managed to squeeze 
through anyway.


SC-23 - Anger (Ryback)
----------------------
This level is incredibly easy to finish - just wait for the Archvile to
notice you, run toward the exit, and that's it. Simplest AV jump
ever. Again, the only difficulty is to get the Archvile to
notice you early - he has this annoying habit of forgetting you
exist. I just played through until I got a fast AV jump.
Should be optimal...


SC-24 - Hatred (Erik)
---------------------
my favourite map in the megawad, also my least shitty demo.


SC-25 - Envy (Adam)
-------------------
I liked this, especially the jump over the gap, which has a little
wallrunning patented. BFG is a must ;)


SC-26 - Fear (Angus)
--------------------
"Oh my god!" - Fear! - yeah, that's the perfect name for this outstanding 
map. The first time I saw this one, I was truly "feared". But after 
watching Ryback's 4:00 run and stx-vile's nm-run I tried it myself, 
did it in speed and pacifist and blasted my through with the nice BFG. 
There is so much health around, so call it easy living.
The best Scythe map IMO. The revenant-infested staircase is a classic :)


SC-27 - Terror (Opulent)
------------------------
Obviously could go a second or two faster, but the window jump
is cool.  You can _not_ telefrag the vile if you get lucky (and awaken
him).


SC-28 - Run From It (Adam)
--------------------------
Very nice to play. You have more than enough time :)


SC-29 - Hell on Earth (Erik)
----------------------------
just showing off a speedrunning trick here, not a very fast demo.


SC-30 - Fire and Ice (Altima)
-----------------------------
Basically a UV Speed duplicate of Vile's NM Speed demo, but 3 seconds 
slower ^^' I'm not quite good enough yet to catch anything but stx-Vile's 
dust ;) 


SC-31 - I Dunno Torn (Ryback)
-----------------------------
The secret exit has all the cool tricks, going this way you actually
have to fight stuff :) My demo is not at all pretty, but at least shows
the way to go.


SC-31 - I Dunno Torn - Secret Exit (Altima)
-------------------------------------------
You can't really say much about an 11 second demo...this came rather 
quickly...kept getting 13, but I wanted faster. This is the end result :)  
Had luck with the Archies too =P In speed, it's still a fun map ^_^ 
Secret exit, also Pacifist.


SC-32 - Enoz Soahc (Angus)
--------------------------
The start is very easy: just jump and run around the chaingunners to 
the lift, this works 5 times out of 6 without losing too much health.
Two problems here: the archie and getting past the hellknights in the 
narrow corridor.
A little bug prevents the monsters to teleport into the final room, if 
you played the former way in pacifist style. A few monsters there 
(a mancubus, a few imps or even a cybie?) would make it more 
interesting.

Descriptions
------------

The descriptions were written by the team member who recorded the map.


SC-01 - Get Going! (OgreSlayeR) 
------------------------------
Pretty decent run. I think 9 might be possible with perfect running.


SC-02 - Punchline (Ryback)
--------------------------
Adam was the first to do the strafe50 jump, I tried to copy his
route but the monsters just wouldn't get out of the way, so I had to
spend a few seconds clearing the path. It's a difficult strafe50 jump
too, you almost have to misalign yourself to make it.


SC-03 - Up and Around (Adam)
----------------------------
This one reminds me much of Episode 1 NightMare (not the level,
the gameplay). I played quite cautious, lots of room for
improvement.


SC-04 - Lost Warehouse (Ryback)
-------------------------------
Low health is a problem here, so I take a detour early on and take the
green armor. Later annoyances are the spectres and lost souls, you can't
just rush past them like you do in UV. Not really a difficult run
though, and there aren't any special tricks to stuff up...


SC-06 - Pressure Point (Ryback)
-------------------------------
A rather embarrassing demo :) It was my first try, not having any
idea how to complete the level, and though it doesn't look great
and there are some obvious ways to improve it, I wasn't able to
finish the level again. Sometimes, you don't mess with luck.


SC-07 - Deadly (Angus)
----------------------
My shortest demo ever :)
My first rocket jump :)
My first optimal time :)
 

SC-08 - Garden Base (Ryback)
----------------------------
This is a lot slower than the speedrun demo, but you need weaponry and
health to run that shotgunner gauntlet (and I can't do that strafe50
jump anyway :) So I take the chaingunner, rocket launcher and
supercharge - and manage to get 100% secrets along the way too.
The inviso sphere is also a big help. You need luck that the mancubuses
don't blast you or block your run, and that the troopers don't bite
away at your health. Hardly difficult, though.


SC-09 - Computer Storage (Ryback)
---------------------------------
Route first shown by Erik, as with most nmare runs the difficulty isn't
in gametic-perfect movement but in a war of health attrition. This
particular run is far from average, usually I'm near death at most points.
I wasn't intending to run past the revenant at the end, but it worked
out just like the rest of this lucky demo :)


SC-10 - The Lords (Ryback)
--------------------------
Adam showed this shortcut first, it makes a short level ridiculously
easy. Switch flip is easy, just leave the platform down before you
jump into the lava. No need to shoot anything, just run the route. 
Considering Adam's general speedrunning perfection, I'm quite happy to
be just one second slower :)


SC-11 - Sneak Peak (Grazza)
---------------------------
I'd got 0:05 16 times, and was at the point of giving up when 
suddenly this happened. I'd tried all sorts of strategies. The 
one here was "stand some way from the exit so the imps could 
deplete my health and hopefully nothing would obstruct the 
revenant's missile; then run for the exit just as it hits". 
Obviously, it is very much luck-dependent (346th attempt!).


SC-12 - Walk in the Park (Ryback)
---------------------------------
The speedrun route is snappy, but there's far too many enemies
at far too many places to just run the level through in nightmare.
I run around picking up weaponry, health, and luring the Barons away
from the blue key. Got *one* of them out :) Don't think you can
significantly improve this, unless you're good enough to dodge past
the mancubus...


SC-13 - Subverted Base (Ryback)
-------------------------------
I take the rocket launcher as it's a very useful route clearer :)
Otherwise it's the same as the speedrun route, and not particularly
harder either.


SC-17 - Book Lords (Ryback)
---------------------------
I wasn't even sure if this would be possible, but with luck at key points
it's fairly doable. The trick to this level is to not make any noise at
all - otherwise, monsters will start to teleport in and it'll rapidly
become impossible. This means a couple of spots where you have to hide
from monsters, the rest is running and hoping. The Archies are particularly
problematic - the first you have to distract with a revenant missile so
he'll let you have the red key; the second you need to hide behind a
bookshelf from; the third will blast you, no way to avoid it.
A 100% secrets demo.


SC-18 - M/S Futura (Ryback)
---------------------------
This one was left alone for a long time, and I'm not sure why, 
it's quite easy :) Although you do have a tendency to lose 
health rapidly here, so some luck is necessary. The main 
strategy is to quickly run to the yellow key, before the mancubus 
can come forward and lower the bridge to it.


SC-19 - 3000 AD (Erik)
----------------------
Added this trick pretty late in the megawad production, not a 
very good trick, but the map would not be very fun for 
speed without it.


SC-20 - The Starport (Ryback)
-----------------------------
This demo is very messy and slapdash, mainly because it's another
first try :) The tricky part of this problem is making the jump
to the blue key, usually it's blocked. That's why I spend some
time at the start killing enemies. I was completely unprepared for
the later part of the level, and seem to have made it 
completely through luck.


SC-21 - Solitude (Erik)
-----------------------
awful demo, this map is very hard on skill 5 :\ 


SC-23 - Anger (Altima)
----------------------
You say even less about a 3 second demo than you do an 11 second demo ;)
Just run straight, Archie-jump to the exit, and you're done ^^ It's 
also optimal, yay!


SC-24 - Hatred (Ryback)
-----------------------
Lots and lots of monsters to dodge here, which means you need luck
and some steady nerves. The key points are taking the blue key (it
wasn't blocked), and picking up the BFG. Usually I die here from
Cybie rockets or baron fire, but the Cybie got distracted by something
and those two barons acted as a very efficient shield :) Made a mistake in
picking up the supercharge, lost a lot of health, and the end
was just a mad rush to the exit holding down the fire key :)


SC-25 - Envy (Ryback)
---------------------
The trick at the start of this level deserves some explanation.
The gap to the right of the first door is too wide to jump normally,
but straferun against the left or right side wall and you'll make it.
Look in a mapeditor at the level, though, and there are no hidden ledges,
just two lines of torches. Is the Doomguy breaking the rules of the game
and running along the top of the torches? No. In fact what's happening
is a trick similar to the map23 barrel run trick - an E-W line of
impassable objects somehow acts as an E-W two-sided wall, which can
be wallrun along. The extra speed boost is just enough to see you
through the gap.

Anyway, this trick is very easy to accomplish, much easier than map23,
and the remaining challenge of the level is to snag the key and avoid
a rocket death from Cybie. He's quick on the draw in nightmare :)


SC-26 - Fear (Vile)
-------------------
Torn requested this one randomly on IRC, this result didn't
take very long.  I saw complete red for a few seconds by a 
well-placed cyberdemon rocket (damn nice shot, man) but was 
somehow blown in the right direction and scooted across 
that hidden ledge to the exit... phew!


SC-27 - Terror (Adam)
---------------------
There is a faster route here but I never really got the hang
of that window jump. This route is quite easy. It's kinda fun to
piss against the wind, if you know what I mean :)


SC-28 - Run From It (Altima)
----------------------------
Ooooo....this was interesting. I die and exit....yay for me ^_^ This 
map was really tough to do on NM...first of all, I can barely exit at 
all with monsters on the map. Secondly, that last stretch of hallway has 
that nasty Arachnotron firing at you and wasting away your health while 
you can't really do much about it but "Run From It" as the map name 
says ;) I'm happy that I got out alive is all ^^


SC-30 - Fire and Ice (Vile)
---------------------------
This one implements a trick designed by Erik during testing 
to make a quicker exit possible for speed-running (which 
could be deduced by the design of the end bars).  This run 
normally leaves me beaten to near death if I even get an 
exit, but the dash to and from the yellow key was unusually 
smooth and damage free... lucky as hell, I tell ya. :)   


SC-31 - I Dunno Torn - Secret Exit (Ryback)
-------------------------------------------
IMO the normal exit route is too long and there are too many enemies
(particularly Demons) to make it in nightmare. Secret exit isn't so hard,
but you need to take it slowly, as health is pretty scarce. I clear
out both AVs then run to the exit... it's actually possible to do
an AV jump across this gap, but not feasible in nightmare.

That's it - enjoy the lmps!
