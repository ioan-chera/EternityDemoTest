Comments:  Finally, after almost five hours I got this. In first 4,5 hours I tried it with BFG
           and gathered about 30 0:31's, a 0:31.02 including :( Then I became mad, my fingers
           began to hurt and I thought: "Shit! Try it without weapons." My first successful
           exit was a 0:32 after 5 minutes, my 3rd a 0:31 after 8 minutes. And this run 10 mins
           later ... arrrgh, what a fool I was. Wasting so much time.
           29 seconds (or 30 with weapons) would be nicer, but now it's bedtime.
