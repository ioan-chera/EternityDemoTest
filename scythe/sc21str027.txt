Comments: Just went for a bruteforce strategy here. Took some time to survive as you need quite a bit of luck with the archvile infighting and the ending; surprised I survived here at all with the health I got to the ending; PE helped out a bit as a shield. Probably could have been 26 without an AV block at the end, but this was kinda hard, so just happy with this first-exit filler.
