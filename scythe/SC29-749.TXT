Demo entry #73.

Description:

My first demo of this winter is recorded for this original, powerful, modernly
designed icy level :-)

It's a typical challenging max run which gets somewhat simplier with practice.
I only worked for two days on this demo, and this semi-crappy third-exit run is
significantly less optimized than, for instance, RQ24-416 or GRA1-557. It's not
a super-smooth demo which makes a hard run look easy, it's a "live" demo with
a number of natural humanly mistakes. But I think some of them are funny,
particularly the health-loss in the end.
                          
Enjoy the hell!
