===================================
Description:

This map is a cold region map with impressive white rock textures. There 
are many unforgettable scenes such as some high and complex buildings, 
a bridge between two buildings, the battle of three cyberdemons after 
the red key, and the exit after climbing the steep white rocks. This is 
no doubt a memorable map.

I had not played UV-Fast for a long time and I found this map's record 
is very old from 2006, so I just tried it. This map was hard to survive, 
so I spent more time than I had expected. 

In the beginning, two arch-viles were very annoying becasue a shotgun 
and a chaingun were not enough to deal with them. If you pick up a SSG 
in the outside area like UV-Max route, they are also likely to go out, 
then it would be even harder for them to kill. Fortunately, many homing 
missiles from revenants helped me to do. The tactic is unique to -fast 
and the credit goes to Anima Zero. A lot of enemies aim you from all 
direction in the outside area. Especially, homing missiles from revenants 
and spells from arch-vile are really dengerous in the field with less 
obstruction. 

I got on the elevator in the red brick building, then shotgunners surrounded 
me. This was also a hard part becasue receiving damage was unavoidable. 
I made a herd of cacodemons fight against the cyberdemon around the blue 
key like UV-Max route. It happended easily with -fast but it was hard to 
avoid damage. 

I entered the blue key's door after I had crossed the bridge, then shotgunners 
surrounded me again and I was usually low health. I paid attention until 
getting a soul sphere. Three cyberdemons were encountered after the red key. 
I could not get close to them well on -fast for taking a blast damage of 
BFG effectively, so I kept enough cell. I was occassionaly killed by them 
becasue of stumbling on unevenness. It was more troublesome than I had expected.

I was also annoying fireball clipping bug occured frequently. This also caused 
low health situation or death. Anyway, I managed to finish this map and got
 below 10 min. It is pretty nice.
