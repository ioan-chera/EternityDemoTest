Comments: Good punch damage output on the demons, no major movement mistakes, yellow key demon got out of my way, and I didn't die at the end, so this was very lucky. I was getting only 37s for a while and I was getting kind of frustrated, but I guess it was worth it at the end (I would have been happy with a 36).
