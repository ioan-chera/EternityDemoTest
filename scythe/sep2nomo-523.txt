Whew, this took a few tries, and my face was red when I was
making this. I probably looked like I needed to go to the
bathroom because I hadn't for about 3 days. XD Anyway, enough
about me, more about the run.

MAP11 (Sneak Peak): 0:16
Very good, I still love my trick. :)

MAP12 (Walk in the Park): 0:18
Minor fumble at the beginning, fortunately I made it up
enough so I only missed a second from average.

MAP13 (Subverted Base): 0:32
Ugh! Can't ever get under 0:30. I was even pushing my strafe
keys hardest. I probably worked hardest on this level.

MAP14 (Power Outage): 0:29
With my new trick of NOT blowing up the barrels and going 
around them, I can get under 30 seconds. :)

MAP15 (Blood Bath): 0:19
I finally figured out the shortcut trick. You'll notice I move
kind of slowly on the platforms, and that's because I've had
excellent runs ruined by missing them. :(

MAP16 (Burial Grounds): 0:31
I am very angry with myself for getting over 0:30! >:{

MAP17 (Book Lords): 0:33
Usual time, usual getting minorly stuck on the wall. Never
improvable on my part, and never under 30 seconds. But I like
this level anyhow. :)

MAP18 (MS Futura): 0:18
Pretty good, I just have to get into the habit of NOT wanting
to go to the plasma rifle area INSTEAD of the blue key area by
mistake.

MAP19 (3000 AD): 1:25
Another boo-boo at the beginning. I missed the switch 3 times!
The worst part of the run! However, I'm glad about the rest
of the level; at least that's OK. When I catch that moving 
platform just in the blue key door, it always seems to be close
to its peak, moving up.

MAP20 (The Starport): 0:42
Last level of Scythe Episode 2. Fun map, but I'm always in the
40 second range. I want to get into the 30 second range some-
day. :)

Total *<5:23>* I think under 5:30 is pretty good. This could
probably be around 5:10 if you corrected all the mistakes I
made and made my run again without them. TAS could definitely
get under 5 minutes, probably around 4:30 or so.
