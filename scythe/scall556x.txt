Description:
I wanted to include the 3 new major tricks discovered since Akse
last did his demo almost 10 years ago. I also wanted to bring the
time under 6 minutes since that should be doable. Again I don't want
to use too many or too sharp turns, so under those constraints
I aim to just complete it as quickly as possible instead of trying 
to optimize things too much as I'd rather finish it then get stuck 
on some minor detail :)

Map 01: I should have done this in 7 seconds, but I would have
had to start over again, too much effort.

Map 03: First new major trick. 0 seconds didn't seem possible to me,
so I go get the shotgun on the way.

Map 04: Difficult jump at the start, I think 38_vita_38 showed
it first some time ago.

Map 06: Second major time save over Akse's run, simple run 
across the gap.

Map 09: I press the first switch through the wall, helped me
save a second here over Akse. Had to spend a few minutes 
fixing up the end section.

Map 10: Akse says he spent 9 hours here, I'll lose a second
and do it in 9 minutes instead.

Map 11: Imps will do the job just fine.

Map 14: Last new major trick, a void glide is possible and
you can press the exit switch from outside! Once you got
out of bounds there's like a step down so you move at 30 units
in both x and y direction for a few tics in the wrong direction,
quite annoying. Still managed to get 9 seconds with some
wallruns thankfully.

Map 15: I have no idea how Akse managed to get shot just as he 
gets out of the teleporter, but I saved time elsewhere so it's fine.

Map 16: Nothing interesting here, like Akse I use a glide 
on the lowering wall.

Map 17: I know I could have saved a second, but would 
take a bit too much effort.

Map 18: Looper has a 2.97 here, I have no idea how long something 
like that would take me so I'll settle for saving 1 second over Akse. 
I can get the soulsphere which will help me with the next map.

Map 19: More health so I can skip the green armor and a quicker 
rocket jump saves a second. Perhaps another second can be saved 
with quicker vile attacks, I'm not sure what the earliest moment 
they can attack is without pain chance though.

Map 20: A long map so I wanted to save a second here. A rocket boost 
out the yellow key window saves a little bit of time. It could be 
possible to skip the linedef that raises the barrier behind you and 
take a shorter route (the switch by the megasphere lowers the barrier, 
the linedef to open the exit is further behind), but it's east and too 
difficult without some monster in the area.

Map 22: What a death exit, it's like doomguy just slided across the roof.

Map 24: Another second save, I suppose the rocket jump + faster 
death exit made the difference.

Map 26: I really wasn't looking forward to this level, getting 
past the revenants, getting the viles to attack at the same time 
and then somehow getting to the exit without getting blocked too 
much. I only had a little bit of trouble getting past the revs 
and finding my way past a few monsters near the exit. I think I 
got a bit lucky with the vile attack timing, surprised to even 
save a second here, and I'm sure I could have saved another.

Map 27: I was actually planning to do a linedef skip here and 
save 2 seconds, but I had already saved enough time at this 
point to get under 6 minutes... but I needed the rocket launcher 
for it and I completely forgot I didn't actually get it on the way. 
Maybe I could have grabbed RL on the previous level and gotten the 
same time. The linedef skip is on the teleporter at the start, 
saves 2 seconds. I just assume it doesn't work without the RL, but I didn't try.

Map 28: Definitely possible to rocket jump off the pillar 
instead of the lost soul :) 2 seconds saved.

Map 30: Getting over the barriers was rather annoying because 
doomguy didn't want to slide in smoothly, good enough to match 
Akse's time. Also should have done a rocket boost earlier on 
before grabbing the mega.
