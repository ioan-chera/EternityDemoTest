Comments:  Team with the spider until all other monsters are
           dead. And then telefrag her. Sounds easy?
           Well, it's not possible to figure out if she's on
           the right spot in the right moment. This is the
           first time I had luck with it this evening (after
           about 10 failed telefragging attempts). And of
           course it was very, very close ;)
