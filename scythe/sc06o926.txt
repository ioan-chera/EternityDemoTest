Comments: Looks much cleaner than my 9.74 and is still not too close to 8s, so I don't think I'm going for that time at the moment. Also included my best run on the no wallrun route which was a 0:21.29. Not too fun on that route due to the wait section either, and it's not the optimal route so I didn't go for 20s much. Might shoot for 20 if I do nomo100, though, as that would be equal to nomo since it's possible to get the secret and even the green armor during the wait sections at the start.
