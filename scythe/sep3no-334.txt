Slowmo was used in the making of this run :)

Wow, Method has a good non-TAS time there. Good job Method! :) However, be-
cause of the extreme fun when recording with TAS, I decided to try episode
3 out.

Here is information about each map and my comments.

MAP21 (Solitude): 0:07 :)
Comments: I was mad when I started with an 0:08.03 so I had to redo it. :P

MAP22 (Despair): 0:18 :|
Comments: Somehow didn't trigger the exit the first time. Otherwise I would
have had 17. >_<

Comments: Run, Doomguy, Run! :D

Comments: The lowering floors are a bit annoying but I love the map. :)

MAP27 (Terror): 0:36 :)
