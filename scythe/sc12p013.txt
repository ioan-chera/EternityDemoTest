  Description:
  Oh yessss! Thanks to AdamH for both the route and leaving 13 to future generations. :)
  I'm not ruling 12 out as impossible, but the imp is one of the most uncooperative
  creatures across all known wads. I've cut the sec away by rushing the barons, of course.
  A pair of cute screwed up 'almost 13s' included, as usual. :)
