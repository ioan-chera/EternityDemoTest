Comments: Something I decided I'd try routing after I realized that this level has chainsaw, berserk, and tons of bullets. Wasn't too difficult to find a route, but executing it was kinda hard; trying to chainsaw the nobles at the first two fights is hard as I need to rely on good infights and not getting hit too much. The archvile fight is just a test of patience, and then I have to survive the end chaos. First exit obviously.
