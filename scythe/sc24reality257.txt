Comments:
I didn't mean to really run the map at first. PJPlaysDoom was streaming his own
UVMax + reality attempts and I wanted to experiment in this map myself to try
and come up with route improvements and send them to PJ, but somehow I managed
to beat his run by over a minute with a 3:33 in ~70 attempts. Unfortunately at
the time he was already getting tired of the map with 1600 and didn't want to
grind it any longer (I'm sorry I didn't mean to streamsnipe). He seemed to
struggle with replicating my strategies in the 3:33 demo, so I refrained from
running the map again until I found out PJ is moving on. I knew sub-3 was
possible but wasn't sure how hard it would be at the time. After a bit of
practice I found out that not very, it just takes some grinding and luck to do,
so I got to work and got the sub-3 after 4 decently frustrating days.

Thanks to Kinetic for his WR normal uv-max 1:55 demo. A lot of inspiration for
my strategies in this demo was taken from it. I couldn't do the revenant fights
as well as he did even after hours of practice but I feel like just trying made
me improve at handling revenants. The route I used is mostly the same as
Kinetic's but adapted/bastardized to be much safer and viable for no damage. I'm
not a great player so the route is also not executed very well. I often got 2:4X
while practicing with saves, so if you're good you can get that or even lower.

Not the first speedrun I've done (second iirc?), but the first I submit to
DSDA
