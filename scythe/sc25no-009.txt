In an attempt to win back some of my nomo runs for Scythe, I'm trying to start
on some of the maps on which I know I can definitely do better than last time.

This is one of them. I ignored the trick at the beginning where you jump across
the pit for the longest time because I thought it required SR50, which I'm not
exactly great at pulling off. Not the case! You can easily SR across it with
the help of the red torches lining the edges of it, due to the wallrunning
possibility it creates. I feel dumb after discovering it. :P At least I know
about it now. (I still think the discovery of my other trick wasn't too bad.)

Anyway, now for some comments about the run. It's not that hardworked, I ad-
mit it. I just got a bunch of 10's and kept trying until I reached a point
where I got a 9 second demo. 9.83 secs is sufficient. ;)

Also, big thanks to Cacatou for realizing there is more potential for Scythe
nomonsters runs and beating the old, crappy times featured in my ancient demos.
