I did this a few days ago on stream.  I tried for 0:22, but it got too annoying.  Possibly the correct route is to jump and activate the switch at the beginning, then proceed as normal.  I got a few 0:24's using the jump route but with movement mistakes or unlucky monster behavior.  0:21 was pretty easy on nomonsters with the jump.
