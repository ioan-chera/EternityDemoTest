Happy Independence Day everyone!

Thanks to MD922 for his demo showing a rocket jump here, which I was determined would be possible and take less time performed as an SR50 jump over the ledge.

This shows an alternative and easier route to doing 2 glides.

It may not be optimal, but I'm darn excited because I only thought 8 would be possible. I got this rather quickly, surprisingly. This makes me happy. :)

Enjoy!
