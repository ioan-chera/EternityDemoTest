Comments: Satisfying to get a demo where virtually everything went right. AV died pretty damn well in the beginning (with good revenant help), and I managed to get good rocket shots at the monster crowd at the end. Few missed shots as well, so I'm happy with this. I had a 2:25 before this, but it seemed stupid to post a 1 second improvement here.

Some changes from j4rio's demo include not shooting in the yellow key area for the sake of obtaining the yellow key easily, although shooting is probably faster. Also, I handle the monster crowd slightly differently by going outside because they tend to get packed pretty tight into the corridor, which results in good blast damage and infighting.
