Demo entry #156.

Description:

This city is loaded with nastiest kinds of baddies (gunners, revenants, archies
and cyberdemons). Also, that dogawful combination of 5 sergeants + 2 mancubi +
a blockmap bug + a noclip bug royally sucks. Even with ideal dodging and aiming
it's easy to lose about 100/100 there.

Still, this action-filled HR2-style masterpiece is great fun to race through on
skill 5. Unlike Shock, I enter the northwestern building through an alternate
blue door. Also, I skip the second megaarmor because I don't want to release one
extra vile.

I only spent 4 hours getting my first exit, 3:00.14. But reaching a better time
was a lot tougher, and I really like the way my final attempt turned out. Enjoy
the extreme shitloads of close calls near the end :)
