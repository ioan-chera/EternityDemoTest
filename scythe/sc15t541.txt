Comments:
My previous demo in 8:53 was an embarrassing and poorly routed filler from 6 years ago, so I wanted to improve it a little bit.  For some reason I played extremely passively at the start (saving bullets I guess), despite ample health, and I waste tons of time running in circles trying to make the AV and arachnotrons infight.  The comments in that demo make it seem it was hard, but its actually a very easy and fun tyson.  I might try to push it down more in the future (there's still a lot of room for improvement), as this is just a second exit.  

I end up shooting the arachnotrons near the end, but the strat I was trying for was to distract them using the imps behind the hell knight.  Unfortunately they had wandered off somewhere...
