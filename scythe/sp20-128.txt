Sub-1:30 is what I was aiming for. 4th exit here. Had
1:40, 1:36, and 1:34, so getting this time was nice. Lots
of luck needed here with the monster positioning. You
need to have a lot of patience at the start and up to the
Blue Key. Once you get that it's smooth sailing to the
exit. Hardest part is definitely just weaving past all of
the monsters and navigating the infights so you can get
through this with minimal problems.

Pretty luck-based past this point I'd guess.
