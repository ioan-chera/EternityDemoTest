Comments: Goal was obviously under a minute, which is very luck-based to get due to all the monsters in my way. I had numerous 1:02s, and I was stuck at that time for a while, but today I was able to pull it down with a few single second improvements (this demo came right after a 1:00). Dunno what a really solid non-TAS time would be, probably 56-57 would be a really tough time to beat.
