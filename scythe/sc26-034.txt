Comments:  After watching last night's sp26-050 again, I tried this new speed-route. And it
           works :)

           Five hours with "Fear" yesterday evening, three hours this morning. Now it's time for
           breakfast - and some good old Charlie Chaplin movies :)

           Enjoy this run! It's probably the last I did this year.
