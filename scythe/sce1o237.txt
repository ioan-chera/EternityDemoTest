I was hoping to improve my old crappy 3:20 demo. Thanks so much to MD922 for posting his episode 1 run on doomworld to motivate me! :)

Times of individual maps and comments are listed below:

MAP01 (Get Going): 0:11.31
Comments: Not too bad, but a little bumpy. Someone who actually cares to have a polished run will try for 10.. or 9.. on this map. :)

MAP02 (Punchline): 0:11.40
Comments: Big time screw-ups here, but at least I got the SR50 jump to work.

MAP03 (Up and Around): 0:18.86
Comments: This one makes me happy. High 18 is pretty good for an episode run.

MAP04 (Lost Warehouse): 0:19.94
Comments: NOOOOO Door trick why u fail me?! :((( Oh well, at least it's not 20. 

MAP05 (Slimy Tunnels): 0:15.74
Comments: Thanks SR50 for making the jumps across the "slimy tunnel gap" easier. Pretty good time, but ofc it can be improved...

MAP06 (Pressure Point): 0:24.63
Comments: 24 is an ok time in an episode run.

MAP07 (Deadly): 0:02.77
Comments: Slow, but at least it's not 3s.

MAP08 (Garden Base): 0:20.40
Comments: Slow again. :( Should be 19 or less.

MAP09 (Computer Storage): 0:24.03
Comments: Bah, .03 is bad. If it had been 23.97 I wouldn't have minded, and even would have commented on this map being well-run.

MAP10 (The Lords): 0:13.60
Comments: Probably the best run of the episode, ironically. This map usually gives me a lot of trouble, but here it worked very well. I'm pleased.

TOTAL: 2:37

Despite the massive improvements, there's still a lot that can be improved. This can easily go under 2:30 with better optimization, maybe even under 2:20 if an excellent
player optimizes this. I'm not all that impressed with this one, but at least it can go on DSDA as a benchmark.

Enjoy (or try to). :P
