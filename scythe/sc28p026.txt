Comments: 26 isn't that hard even with monsters, just a little more luck-based at some points, and movement needs to be tighter to get below 27. Got a little tedious after a while, but I've come to kind of appreciate the movement in this map. I had the linedef skip for the lowering floor near the end of the map in this attempt, but it's not necessary for 26 (I had 27.06 without it); it's pretty difficult to use either way because by the time the linedef skip happens, I'm pretty much stuck in a strafe50 and can't use the skip. Included is a bonus demo of another less beneficial linedef skip of the revenant raise at the end; the revenant is placed right in my path, so he blocked me pretty often (this happened on at least three attempts).
