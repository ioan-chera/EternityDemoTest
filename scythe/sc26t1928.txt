Comments:  Alright, i was really curious how far can it be pushed. I feel like if you grab all the keys right from the start to activate that crusher and manage
	   to kill the first triplet under ~6 minutes, the whole run can be around 15 minutes. I'm still not sure if it's better to shoot from the start or not though.
	   And while i think that lower time can be possible, i don't really know if i can squeeze the time much lower. Also as a side note it helps a lot to kickstart
	   infighting between the triplets and the starting area right when you drop down, so when the skeletons appear there will be less of them at 2-4 minutes mark,
	   which is the time i usually managed to get to the invulns and key teleports.
