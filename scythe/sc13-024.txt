Comments:

The second new trick I've discovered for "Scythe"... :-)

Not too hard to find for a non-Grazza ;-) actually. I mean, 
the key is right there, and the ledge is right there. Why 
not try a keygrab?

The grab isn't very hard in the sense that it doesn't 
require any technical excellence from the player. You don't 
need to use strafe50, you don't even need to strafe. It is, 
however, horribly random, and my success rate with monsters 
was laughable -- during *at least* 200 attempts, I managed 
to get the damn key 4 times.

So, please forgive me if you don't think the rest of the 
run is very polished... I've had enough of this for now!

Pacifist, too (of course).
