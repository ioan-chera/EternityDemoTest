Comments:

Here is a pacifist, too. This run brings a new meaning to the 
word "annoying", as any monster along the way can ruin the 
run for you. Mostly the Arch-Vile, as usual, but man how I 
grew to hate those zombiemen. >:-( This took me at least 200 
attempts (I wasn't counting, but I'm pretty sure of it), and 
my second best was "only" a low 0:29.

The ending looks wierd, because I ran too close to the ledge 
for the second AV jump. Fortunately, I got onto it anyway, and 
didn't lose that much time.

Awakening the monsters before riding the lift is sometimes 
helpful (i.e., some monsters move out of the way), and other 
times counterproductive. ;-)

Including a Ronge style demo, sc19haha.lmp featuring the 
bouncing corpse. :-)
