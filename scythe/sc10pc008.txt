4shockblast:

Hate the movement on this map even in IL; two players means both have to do it cleanly and not get in each other's way, so it's even worse. With better quickstart, I imagine 7s is possible, but this is fairly clean anyway; at this point, 7s may as well be TAS only anyway. :^)

GarrettChan:

The movement at the beginning of the map is... actually quite annoying to do well. Basically I just need to wait for the exit to open and get in. Though, this takes surprising amount of attempts and I was trained to just reset after a certain amount of time. Therefore whenever 4shock actually presses the switch successfully, it takes a bit for me to react because I'm so expected to see a reset there, and I often bumped into the wall... This is one of those rare cleaner runs we got.
