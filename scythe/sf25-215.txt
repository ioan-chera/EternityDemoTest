Comments: 
One strategy change which can be seen at the 1st Soulsphere, otherwise same route/strat as usual.

Not a bad run.  One strat change...hello 6 second improvement :)!  Still a few rough spots, plus my health gets low near the end, but otherwise all worked out in the end.

Perhaps 2-3+ more seconds can be shaved off with little/no mistakes.
