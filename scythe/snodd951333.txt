I just watched Cacatou's nomo demo of all of Scythe and it inspired me
to make my own. Scythe is a great PWAD. :)

As a general note, most of what made my time much better was the fact
that I did not take the secret exits and run on the secret levels. In
nomonsters mode, 100% secrets is not required, so MAP31 and MAP32 are
not required according to the DSDA info page. I'm surprised Cacatou
included them. Probably if Cacatou had not included them, or had I
included them, I would have only beat his run by 5-8 seconds.

This is a first-exit demo.

Comments about each map are below:

MAP01: Meh, I could've worked to get 10, but I'm too lazy.

MAP02: I'm happy about this one because I normally really screw up the 
	jump. Here it went fairly smooth and didn't cost me an extra sec.

MAP03: 17 is possible but it seems hard, especially in a multilevel run.

MAP04: This trick was actually nice to me in ALL of my attempts. Yay. :)

MAP05: Bah, got confused by YK. Otherwise ok.

MAP06: Could have been better.

MAP07: I expected 2 seconds. :)

MAP08: 19 would have been nice but this is ok.

MAP09: How the **** did I screw up such an easy jump?!!? wtf

MAP10: I hate this map. Switch trick was annoying and killed most of my
	attempts before this one. Thankfully it worked well here.

MAP11: Pretty good running, but man just a couple tics away from 15.
	Cacatou used my route here, so I used it again. I feel pretty 
	honored. :)

MAP12: I'm content here. Easy map. Also easy to get 14 though.

MAP13: 30 is meh. 29 would have been a lot better. RK grab is very
	unreliable so I have to go the long way (I've never gotten it
	before in a single level run either).

MAP14: Very happy here. This one is nice and smooth for a multilevel run.

MAP15: Only bad because I paused on the ledge and grabbed RSK when I didn't
	need to (not a big penalty though). At least it's not 14.

MAP16: This was pretty good. :)

MAP17: Happy here also. :) Pretty smooth except near the end.

MAP18: I wish it was 15. The 2 glides are unreliable so I pick up both keys.

MAP19: 2nd fav map in Scythe. :) Fun one to run. I was a bit cautious by
	the YK since I didn't want to fall. I also think I had a bit better
	luck than Cacatou with that perpetual lift.

MAP20: Close to 38, but I like that it's under 40.

MAP21: DANG! This makes me angry.. almost a 10.

MAP22: On the other hand, I didn't expect .94 here. :)

MAP23: Ok. Running is pretty smooth, but 25 would be better.

MAP24: Got confused after opening the blue door so I lost a couple secs.

MAP25: This map came up and I instantly realized, "Crap, I forgot to
	practice this jump beforehand." Because of that, I did my old
	reliable trick.	

MAP26: I was a wimp on the skinny ledge near the exit and lost a second.

MAP27: Good in some parts, shaky in others. 56 or 57 is nice for a
	multilevel run. I can't ever get that window jump so I went the
	long way.

MAP28: I always suck at maps like this. 30 would've been nice.

MAP29: My fav of all time from original Scythe! Unfortunately at the end
	I got a little confused with the switches, so it's not under 1:35.
	The YK grab is annoying so I went the long way here.

MAP30: Got a bit too excited and failed an easy jump. Fortunately it didn't
	cost me much. Good BFG work at the end IMO.

Without screw ups in MAP09 and MAP30, this would be under 13:30. :P 
However, I want to wait until Cacatou or somebody else takes back the
record before I try recording another demo for all of Scythe. Cacatou was
right; this is very fun to record.

Enjoy!
