Comments: Very solid run in my opinion. sub 1 is possible but you need perfect RNG for that to happen. The map is fun apart from a few demons not teleporting quick enough.
	  It can get very annoying as it happens very often. Which is why I waited for a second as I thought one more demon was gonna appear. At the exit, I yolo the switch
	  as my pb was 1:05 and I noticed the timer hit 1:04 so I just ended it. I had no idea that I killed the baron or not. It died 4 or 5 frames eariler, so very close. 
	  ggs!
