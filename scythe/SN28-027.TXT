Description:

Well, here's the finale of my long "Run from It" story, which is described in my
SS28-029.TXT. Even half a day ago (when I got my new NM100S record), I still
didn't think that I can reach 0:27 in NM Speed. Kimo said that it's a difficult
run. But I think the level is very easy to survive compared to my other runs
(even similarly short ones). However, executing the whole sprint with perfect
precision is quite a challenge. I knew 27 is technically possible with keyboard
only (without any shortcut tricks, 180-turns or auto-Strafe50), but didn't think
it's feasible for me in one try out of a million, until I pulled it out in these
lucky hours. Now over 2/3 of my straferunning here is SR50 (shown in LMPDET),
and no doubt that Kimo also could get 27 on Nightmare this way.
