Description:

I've been trying to do this run since a year or so, from time to time..
Previously i had 3:42 and 3:22 which was super ugly. Today i made this
and i think it's getting close to a good time. Still it was my 3rd
or 4th try today, which could explain the unsure and in general slow
movement in some parts but i hope you will or have already enjoed it!

MAP01 : Easy but 10 is well possible as well as 12 or 13...
MAP02 : ... still easy
MAP03 : but this one is probably the most difficult map in the whole run.
	For a long time i was trying to do it pacifist style which
	can be faster but is more difficult, anyway this is one of my
	better times.
MAP04 : Only the red key can be a little nuisance.
MAP05 : I often had to go for the berserk and then was late for the yellow
	key, so this time it was not the worst.
MAP06 : Perfect, credits to the hell knights.
MAP07 : I've never done the straight forward jump yet ;)
MAP08 : Too low health towards the end and still i missed most
	of the medikits... :/
MAP09 : ...so i tried to be careful here and the time is quite bad
	and the ending is rather amusing ;)
MAP10 : Ok
