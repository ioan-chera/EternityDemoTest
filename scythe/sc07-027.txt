Comments   : This was another fun one to run.  There's a few lucky bits like the first and second telefrags
             as well as how cooperative the spiders are, since some of them will chase after you rather
             than move closer to the end teleport as they did here.  I believe the final time was around
             27.80 so I am pleased enough with this one.
