I found a way to save some miniscule amount of time right at the start.
First, you can bypass forced shotgun swap even if you use chainsaw at
sarge point-blank. Obviously unreliable and random. Second, now that
there is no need to use pistol, you can go straight for chainsaw. To
unleash it a tiny bit faster, you can use weapon swap shortly before
grabbing it. The awkward placement of that chainsaw doesn't really help
though. Lower times should be quite reachable, but those constant 
restarts in first 5 seconds aren't particularly motivating.
