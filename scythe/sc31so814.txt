Comments: Very close to 7s, but I dunno if I can get it. A fast time depends on getting past the staircase descent quickly, which happened in this exit, and the turn up the second staircase was good. Platform section seemed a bit slow, though, and XDRE2 shows 2 tics lost to a theoretical optimal door opening at the end. Still, I'd need to save 4 tics on the platform section or elsewhere, and while that may very well be possible, at the moment I can't see where I could save that time. First tic turn would be nice, but I can't get that to happen in PrBoom+, and getting an optimal platform section or door opening is too difficult given how annoying it is to hope for a fast staicase descent. I'd put some more time into it, but I don't really like the run very much, and I don't want to a huge amount of time on it and get no results. :P

Also included old 8s run.
