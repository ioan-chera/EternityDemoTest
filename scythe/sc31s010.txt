Comments:

I like this map... one of my many favourites from "Scythe". The 
speedrun here is just to my taste; I love these kinds of runs. 
Unfortunately, this isn't pacifist style, as I place two well-
timed SSG shots here. Especially shooting the Mancubus at the 
stairs helps a lot (you can squeeze by it on the inside if you 
"freeze" it!). 0:10 is also possible pacifist style, but will 
be much tougher.

I would like to send out a special greeting to this map's author 
Kim "Torn" Bach. His project Doom Advent Calendar 2005, featuring 
a map a day until Christmas Eve, is a fun initiative!
