Map 1: 0:12
-Acceptable, 11 seconds would be preferable but im not going to reset off a second.

Map 2: 0:25
-Ugh, always sucks when an enemy gets in your way

Map 3: 0:32
-Very annoying map, difficult to deal with the pinkies.

Map 4: 0:23
-Good

Map 5: 0:24
-Thumbs up.

Map 6: 0:37
-Awful map, I generally reset when I fail an SR50 attempt but for some reason I decided
to keep on going.

Map 7: 0:04
-You can exit this map with 48 health, but 41 isn't too bad. The extra 7 health acts as a
nice buffer for the zombieman and potential mancubus hit in the next map.

Map 8: 0:25
-Scary map, it's very easy to get hit by mancubus projectiles that glitch through the wall.

Map 9: 0:33
-Thought I would fall down before the red key as I was caught by a monster for a split second.

Map 10: 0:15
-Good

Map 11: 0:14
-Good

Map 12: 0:24
-Woah, that was way too close. I panicked and tried to pick up an imaginary medkit.

Map 13: 0:47
-Ty to shockblast for getting me to use the chaingun which is more consistent.

Map 14: 0:44
-Baron block :(

Map 15: 0:33
-Two mistakes on this map, messing up a few jumps and having to back off since the archie
started to channel.

Map 16: 0:38
-Got the telefrag!

Map 17: 0:45
-hardest episode 2 map, I had to slow down near the beginning due to very low health.

Map 18: 0:28
-Took some hits but relatively fast.

Map 19: 0:51
-Was too far right on the second archie jump means that I lost los.

Map 20: 1:03
-mediocre

Map 21: 0:27
-such a butt-clenchy map, just happy to get out of here without a death.
 
Map 22: 1:09
Cyberdemon was very nice and came to the backside.

Map 23: 0:10
-Decent archie luck but lost up to 6-7 seconds from an optimal archie.

Map 24: 0:49
-Minor mistake on my BFG timing for the two barons, I get absolutely rocked at the end.

Map 25: 0:27
Had to go slow due to low starting health.

Map 26: 0:53
Ty to cyberdemon531 for the safe and consistent fear strat.

Map 27: 0:23
-Archie attacked me quickly which is great.

Map 28: 0:31
-Great execution, minor bump made it 0:31 instead of 0:30.

Map 29: 0:36
-Great time here.

Map 30: 0:39
-Woo, got through the gauntlet!!!!!!!!!


Great overall improvement but I think we'll be seeing scythe go under 15:30 soonish.
