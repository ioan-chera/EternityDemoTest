  Description :)
  
  After seeing Artem's nm100s run, I decided to try
  this map's UV Max, checking Vile's nicely planned max
  run carefully, I noticed he doesn't get the secret
  but he barely made it before dying from the time limit

  Executing Vile's route doesn't leave you time to get
  the secret because you'll need to run back and get it
  from behind the dying arachno and thus wasting needed time
  You need to kill the chainie first to activate the secret

  So I thought about this hell of an awkward route
  The main idea is to have 2 bfg shots ready for the final
  room so you can get the secret on the way without sacrificing
  much time, and so this route came. I shoot ssg at the air
  till I have 2 shells left, to make it switch off faster when
  I run out of ammo, so the revenant dies from one ssg shot and
  one rocket instead of one single bfg shot as in Vile's route

  So after shooting the ssg shot I need to press 5 at the correct
  time to switch immediately to rl and after shooting the rocket
  I press 7 to switch immediately to the bfg, yes really!

  My target was only 32s, I couldn't complete a single run because
  I've always ran out of time at the end
  (See the fail folder for 5 close demos)
  After 3 straight hours I've got this run where everything's fallen
  into place, good running, good timing of switching weapons and
  good timings of shooting the rocket and bfg just after switching
  to them (It gets really confusing if you know what I'm talking about)
  and also a key thing for this time, is how I activated the secret,
  I managed to activate the secret in the box and get out very quickly
  
  My route kills all the reachable monsters and gets the secret.
  Human Optimal is 0:31 (I claim this run is optimal!)
  Vile's route kills all the reachable monsters without getting 
  the secret. Human Optimal is 0:30 or maybe 0:29

  sc28b-uv.lmp from the demopack is a tas demo that kills all the
  monsters including the hidden zombies that die and make the
  teleporting corpses (They all die around the end of 0:33 assuming you
  move immediately at the beginning of the run) but it doesn't get the
  secret.
  
  Note:
  I could've tried to use the rl first against the rev then ssg
  but it seems after you run out of the rocket ammo, you are
  FORCED to switch to normal sg if you only have 2 shells left
  no matter if I press 3 or not

  The "lol" folder contains 4 different demos where I hit the lost
  soul with the rocket while intending to shoot the chainie
  I survive with 3hp in one of them :P

  Enjoy!
