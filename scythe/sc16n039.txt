Yay!  Story on this one...I started out with a :41 exit today using the tactic of hitting exit switch thru the final Arch-Vile.  Problem is...I fumbled with the RSK switch.  I didn't want that, so I tried some more.  After dozens and dozens of attempts, I got a :40.  It still looked a little ugly in places, but at least it was better looking than the :41.  After that, I decided to give it one last shot.  After another batch of attempts, this comes up.

Took 80+ attempts today just to get this demo.  I play more aggressively at the start compared to my previous :46 for the level.  After that, my Berserk+Megaarmor strategy went perfectly.  Heck, it went so well that I really didn't need to pick up the Medkit I usually save before going into the Church.  1st part of Church went well.  After hitting RSK switch, the revenant downstairs wasn't as cooperative as he was in my :46.  He also gets blasted into the teleporter by my Plasma Gun, but wasn't dead yet.

The next part...well, let's just say that considering it's Nightmare difficulty, I had a very close call here.  

The final Arch-Vile was easy, just blasted him a few times to make sure I wouldn't fail in hitting the exit switch thru it and then...well, hit the exit switch ^_^.

All in all, I must say I'm happy with the time I got.  If there were any mistakes, they were very minor.  

Time-wise, it may be possible to improve it a bit more.  Perhaps :38 or :37 is possible.
