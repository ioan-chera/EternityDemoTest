Comments:  Here is a new category for Doom: speedrunning
           with death abuse. (Very common in other games,
           check SDA.)

           If you continue after death the map will not be
           reset. This can be very useful for speedruns if
           the exit is near the start, as you can see in
           this demo.

           But there are of course other possibilities,
           like pa02 for example. ;)

           (This demo only plays back in prboom-plus with
           -solo-net.)
