  Description: 
    
  Whooo the biggest crap you have ever seen. It was pretty hard for me 
  to complete without some tyson experiences. So at least I learned
  something new. With berserk right at the start I tried it just for
  fun but then I was scared of every little monster (even troopers)
  in my way. :)
