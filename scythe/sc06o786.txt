Comments: Pro-tip: turn on vert mouse for this run, then the wallrun happens frequently. The extra slowdowns you get from values lower than MF50 is minimal, but it brigns you just a bit closer to the wall when you strafe50 alongside it, which is exactly what you need to get wallruns. I spent about 300 attempts on this in October, but gave it a random try today and got 8.66 and this in literally sub-5 minutes, under 100 attempts. Efficient. :^)
