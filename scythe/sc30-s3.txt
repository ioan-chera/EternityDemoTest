Description :
Pretty Cool level here! Big time difference between skills 3 & 4, namely that on skill 3 it
turns into an all out BFG Smash-a-thon.... :) Pretty wild though, you still have to have 
the Cyberdemons around to take out the majority of the monsters. Or else you'll run into
trouble at the end if you dont have enough cells. A really cool note here is that this demo
is a skill 3 maxdemo, Viles skill 4 maxdemo is about 30 seconds FASTER then this one here, 
and if you dont think theres much of a difference on those two skills I'd try it out. Drew
did an awesome demo for this map, and his time shows what kind of player he is... In my 
opinion he'd have to be the equivilant of the current Anders Johnsen!!! GREAT max run there
Vile, definitely one of those that stand apart from all the others. Enjoy the lmp guys, I 
had fun making it...
