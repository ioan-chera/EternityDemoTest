This demo is free to beat.  Here's a few ways:
1) Kill both zombiemen with barrels before yellow door
2) Open yellow door before punching imp
3) kill pinky after yellow door with barrel
4) Final imp not taking 2 punches.

352 attempts, not counting the 1000 more attempts I did after getting this.  I might have a lower 47demo, but this is the only one I renamed unfortunately.
