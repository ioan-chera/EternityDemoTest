4shockblast:

Strafejump still seems not that useful to me, not much faster than the previous co-op time. But, it does help lure a lot of stuff out early for the BFG shots, and it's not clear that I would be useful if I was in the same place as Garrett since we would probably get in each other's way. My side is a bit sloppy at times, perhaps if I were faster, I could have time to pick up RL and help a bit in some parts too as I wait a bit at the end in this run.

GarrettChan:

A very confusing map to route around. I don't think we did the best for routing this map, but in the meantime this map has very annoying moving parts to route... I don't need to do any tricks, but I can definitely do better for the final few monsters to exit quicker.
