Your traditional nomonsters demo of a map. It has its usual silly errors such
as wall bumps, but it is much improved. I just wanted to push this down a sec
and take back the record here. :P

It would be fun to see this even faster (I was lazy and stopped soon after I
got this demo), so good luck to Cacatou or anybody else who tries to get 27 
seconds for this map!
