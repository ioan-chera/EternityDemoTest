  Description :)
  
  I said I'm going for 9s and when I got this fastest 10s run.
  I spent a long while trying to do a faster one as I thought this
  one was slow when I was stopped at the door at the end but then I
  rewatched it and I found the run to be pretty good and I actually
  got boosts from monsters at the end. I think if 9secs is possible
  in this map, it should be very very hard
