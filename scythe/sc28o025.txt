Comments: Another run I knew for a while was possible but didn't want to bother with 100 health RJ. It's not a hard RJ, but 100 health makes it tougher. It's not too precise anyway, but 25 requires a somewhat clean run, which is tough with that red screen after RJ messing movement. Still a small bump, dunno about 24, I got it in practice in an episode run with RJ, but there I start with a rocket launcher, and it took a lot of effort to get it even with rerecords. So, I'm probably happy with 25s.
