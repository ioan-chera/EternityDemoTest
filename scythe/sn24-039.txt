Comments:  The luck I had at the blue door is
           incredible, but ...

           Yeah, I heard "Dreamline" from Rush
           while recording this, and felt
           immortal - for a limited time.

           Here's Neil Peart's chorus of this song:

              WHEN WE ARE YOUNG
              WANDERING THE FACE OF THE EARTH
              WONDERING WHAT OUR DREAMS MIGHT BE WORTH
              LEARNING THAT WE'RE ONLY IMMORTAL-
              FOR A LIMITED TIME.
