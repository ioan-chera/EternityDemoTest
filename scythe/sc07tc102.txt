4shockblast (aka. Arachnopuncher):

Garrett herds the arachnotrons, while I beat the shit out of them; that's true teamwork. Their absurd hitboxes can't hurt me now! That is, until they randomly switch to me sometimes anyway, so I still need to get a bit of yolo punching luck.

Anyway, with this strategy, the final time is dependent on how fast the telefrags are, and how fast I stuck the arachs. Also, the end jump, which would have been nice to get. Sub-1 clearly possible with just that, and probably can get a bit luckier elsewhere.

GarrettChan (aka. Arachnoshepherd):

The first part about the Mancubi, I basically get all the bullets I can get just to prevent it running out, and try my best to tell when 4shock can telefrag the Mancubi.

The second part is more tricky that I need to tag all the Arachnotrons and force them to target me instead of 4shock, and maybe deal a little bit of damage at the time. Moving around in the center zone can prevent damage, but you're surrounded by all sides, so you can't really prevent all the damage.
