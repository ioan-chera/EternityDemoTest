Comments: 65 monsters, berserk pack at start, supersphere, megasphere, mega-armor, green armor all relatively easy to access.  Easy right?  This is way harder than I ever could have expected.  Four times I died from those two exit room archviles.  I died about equally as much from the arachnotrons, who just fail to be distracted.  I have no idea if this is a good time or not.  I played aggresively when I could, but I had to maintain health for the exit room.  Caco telefrags went much better than usual.
