I DON'T KNOW IF GRABBING THE ARMOR WAS A GOOD IDEA, IT TOOK ME SOME SECONDS BUT GAVE ME MUCH MORE
RESISTANCE, I THINK YOU CAN REFUSE IT, THOUGH I GRABBED IT FOR SAFETY REASONS.

EASY MAP, WITH SOME LUCK THOSE LOST SOULS WON'T BLOCK YOU WHEN RUNNING TO THE EXIT. I THINK THAT IF YOU 
WON'T PUNCH THE AIR, THEY WON'T SPAWN. JUST DO YOUR BEST
