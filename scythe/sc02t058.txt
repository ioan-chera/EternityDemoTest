Description:
Today was a really unlucky day, previous attempts were hampered by the fact
that I constantly 3-5 shotted (!!!) pinkies with berserk and sometimes got
screwed over by imps not dying from 1 hit, critically messing me up.
Could be better but I'm not 4shockblast, his UV-Max strats are insanely
good. His UV-Max run is basically a Tyson but without the secrets, so this
could even go LOWER than his UV-Max 0:48
