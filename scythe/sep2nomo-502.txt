Dang it! It must be very hard to get under 5 minutes! Well, I know I can save
a second on MAP13, MAP17, and MAP18. That would get me 4:59, and on MAP11, I
have played it enough I'm almost to the point of getting 15's on that map! :0
But no, I always bump into something (as most players do at least once in a 
run). I wanted to try to improve my Episode 1 nomo run, but it was too hard
with all the tricky jumps and such, so I got annoyed at it and decided to try
episode 2 again for some more fun. :) I'm very fortunate and glad I got 5 sec-
onds faster than my previous run, and for all you speedrunners, you know 5
seconds is quite a long time! :D I guess I'll just keep trying, and possibly
get under 5 minutes sometime.
