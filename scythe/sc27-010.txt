Comments:

The window trick jump is very awkward, which the rest 
compensates for by being very easy. I do the jump closer 
to the window, and with strafe50, which I found easier 
than doing it further away. 

Not telefragging the Arch-Vile is completely random; I 
had five prior attempts where I killed it. Anyway, good 
map, fun session. :-)
