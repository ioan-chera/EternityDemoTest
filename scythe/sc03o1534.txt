Comments: I don't know why but I kept struggling at getting a clean run towards the first switch during the start, so this took me a good 15 minutes to beat. 
Otherwise run wasn't that hard, just needed a bit of clean movement, it's pretty beatable by a few tics due to my somewhat late press at the yellow pillars.
