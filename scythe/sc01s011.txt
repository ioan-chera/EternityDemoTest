Comments: Even easier to get 11 NM100s than 9 NM-Speed. Strafe50 used this time on the run to the chainsaw secret (though even without it, I think 11 should be possible). First exit was .86, decided I'd get a slightly cleaner exit, and this was the first improvement I got. First staircase didn't go ideal and the ending had some ugly turns, so maybe 11.6x is possible at least. With more strafe50, it could be taken down even further, but I doubt that 10 could be done.
