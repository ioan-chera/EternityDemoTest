Comments: Not actually that hard, I guess I was lazy last time. First 23 was 23.83, but I had a door bump, so I improved it. .6x, at least, should be possible, but my goal was mostly clean movement, not interested in full-on optimization (I don't think 22 is possible). Also, unfortunately fired pistol accidentally, heh.
