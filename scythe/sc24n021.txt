Comments: First I took the soul sphere before the lift because I thought it was easier (I also took the soul sphere after yellow key). After trying the pacifist route, I found it was doable, so I ended up going for it, and on my first exit with it, I got scared and picked up yellow key soul sphere even though I didn't need to. :D Of course, I had to improve it again, happy I matched Pacifist time, as most runs that I did practice on ended up at 22 seconds. Previous exits included.
