Comments:

What a nice map! I followed Erik's and Ryback's great route, 
and added a new trick: grabbing the invuln through the wall. 
It's pretty easy, you get it at least 4 times out of 5.

This run went pretty well for the most part -- I almost 
wrecked it at the end (by running to close to the ledge for 
the second AV jump), and the very last few seconds aren't 
good, but I was so lucky with the Arch-Vile here that I 
really can't complain. :-)

Pacifist is cool for this map, too, I think I'll try that 
next!
