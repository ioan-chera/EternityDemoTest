Comments:  A fun map :) Even it is frustrating how the hellknights
           react. Two into the crusher needs some luck. Never got
           three this way.
           8 seconds faster than Altima is nice, but it's still
           damn slow. At least the first part (a demon died in a barrel
           explosion) and the final fight are ok here.
