Every speedrunner knows a second is a LONG time during a gameplay. In MAP12 and
MAP13, I lost one second per each level, so that's two seconds hurting my time
(this could've been 5:05). However, the real improvements came in MAP18,and 
MAP20. MAP18, I finally didn't hesitate on where the blue key was, and in MAP20
I just had faster running altogether. So, I'm still anxious about getting a
time under 5 minutes, but I'm progressing nicely, I think. (I hope that doesn't
sound like bragging; I don't mean for it to sound like I am.) :)
