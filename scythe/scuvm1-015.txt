Description:  Originally a shot at a category this didn't meet requirements for (originally was a UV Fast attempt but I missed the part about it needing to be a UV Max run as well, whoops!).  At the advice of others I have modified this file to categorize this as UV Speed with -fast enabled.  Very Short but strangely fun it can be a pain when the RNG goes bad for you and the hitscanners chunk your health off rapid fire style.  Strangely though I find the idea of doing a UV Speed run with -fast flag an interesting thing so I might do this type of thing again in the future for fun.
