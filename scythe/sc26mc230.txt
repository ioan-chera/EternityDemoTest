GarrettChan's comments pretty much sum it up, but I think one more cycle at least is doable, one day we'll have to redo it. I figured out after you can skip the rev linedef; should be easy enough in SP with quickstart and one player, as there's a simple strafe40 angle for it, but not so much in 2P, where you have no quickstart and have to skip together.

Probably will just go with the regular route in the future and hopefully just grind it out. It's actually a rather fun run; I really expected it to be much more painful with the crossfire and difficulty in routing, but it was fine. I guess we've also improved at co-op gameplay since the respawn run, so maybe that was a factor. :D

GarrettChan:

We have completely no idea how bad the Rev closet design is in this map until we actually tried it.

First, it's actually really difficult to do slaughter map in co-op efficiently because it's very easy to get caught on crossfire and kill your partner or get killed by your partner. Therefore, we made a route similar to the Respawn run we did, so we'll be at a different spot whenever we're trying to get the keys etc.

Then, the real way to deal with the Rev closet is to trigger the switch behind the 3 keyed door as soon as possible and a crusher will be activated to kill all those Revenants, but still there are a handful of them in the buffer lift and you have no real way to kill them.

Last... get lucky with the Cyberdemon fights. The Revenants came in waves so right now we can't really get into the previous cycle to finish the map. Therefore, it's always around 2:30... Hopefully one day we can find a way to finish one cycle earlier.
