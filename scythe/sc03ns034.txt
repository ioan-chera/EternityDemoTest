Description :

What a map... 4shockblast plays it pacifist, to avoid spawning enemies.
I only tried a few times, but didn't get lucky with the shotgunners.
I chose the normal way, but the map gets really crowded after the berserk.
It's the only exit I got in this whole practice session.
I ran too far at the end but managed to press the exit switch while being bitten by a pinkie :)
