Comments: 499 attempts. Faster than UV-Speed. Slowish glide, so I strafe50ed after teleing to the end and just barely made it. Instant glide happened every once in a while with my new technique, so I think 5 seconds is possible nomo, might try that another time. Jump is still annoying, though, especially with manc in the way.
