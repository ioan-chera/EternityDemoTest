Comments: Revisiting the first map that I ever speedran! This is a much better demo as I've improved, but still looks ugly ^_^. 
If I ever submit a sc04m demo again, it'll be a sub 40s run. I used Kyle McAwesome's route. From the start, I drop down
and kill the shotgunner, get rid of imps and grab the armor. I try to pair my movement with the shotgun usage to save time. Not 
the best movement here. Now, just pick up the shotgun and shells by the imps, and get rid of 'em one by one. Ignore the lost souls
that spawn in after grabbing the key, they don't count as kills for max runs. yeah, this mostly consists of taking enemies out with
the shotgun as you encounter them. Once again, sub 40s is within my reach because of how ugly my movement was in the outdoor area. 
I'm proud of this run because it made me realize that I have improved at maxing, that can make watchable max demos, as well as 
tackle other maps with more confidence now. Thanks for watching if you did <3 it was fun to revisit the map.
