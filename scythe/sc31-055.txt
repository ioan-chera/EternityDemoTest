Comments:

This was recorded around the same time as the secret exit speedrun, 
but somehow I forgot to post it. Anyway, here it is! :-)

A lot can go wrong in this run -- the Baron/Hell Knight "cage" can 
easily kill you and you also have to make sure you don't get stuck 
on too many monsters (they come in large groups here!). I lost some 
time here and there, but it's still a good run, apart from the 
lousy ending, which I could and should have done much faster (but I
chickened out). :-/

Thanks to Chris "Ryback" Ratcliff for coming up with the route.
