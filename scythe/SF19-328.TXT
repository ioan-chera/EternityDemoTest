Description:

IMO the most awesome level in the whole wad. Levels 12-18 are progressively
wonderful in their industrial charm, but 19 overshadows them all. And I really
would like to know where did Erik take this terrific, oppressive music which
perfectly fits the futuristic feel of this map.

In 2005 (when MAP19 wasn't yet done with -fast), I recorded it in 4:45 and was
proud to be not too far from Vile's regular UV time. But in 2007, I rerecorded
it in 3:45 on a more modern route. However, I thought it was not a decent
improvement over Anima's 4:04, so here's the result of yet another route
replanning :-)
