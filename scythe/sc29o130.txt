Even though 1:2x is very possible, I only bothered to push this down to
1:30. Obvious improvements would be handling the switch/door thing better
by the YK, not bumping into as many things, but mostly using better
straferunning. 

Also, if you could grab the YK early, you could probably do this map well
under a minute. I don't know if that would work though, and I'm not trying
it since I'm extremely terrible at pulling off KG tricks. (This is how
bad I am: AV02 and E3M4 drive me up a wall, and they're easy ones!)
