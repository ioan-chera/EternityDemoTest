Simple level. Just run around and grab the keys, then go back near the
beginning to exit. I took less than 10 minutes to get 12s, so it's a
rather quick demo, and you can see a few flaws in my running (bumping into
the wall gently after I grab the RSK; a tic-long pause as I stop to grab
the YSK so I don't bump into the wall by it; getting into too much of a 
hurry at the exit and bumping into an opening door). Definitely improvable.
