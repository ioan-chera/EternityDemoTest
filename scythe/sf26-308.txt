Comments: This was merely an experimental demo to improve the time using Angus' route, unfortunately I was unable to perceive Tatsurd's improved route. It took 2 hours to successfully survive the frantic sprint towards the teleporters and even then the Cybers did not cooperate and infight, perhaps due to a flaw with my technique. Nonetheless I'd like to upload this run in any case, merely as evidence of another speedrunner to conquer this exposed warfare in -fast.
