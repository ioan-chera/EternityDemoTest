Fun map for nomo 100, and it forces a slightly longer route. I got high 23 within like 2 minutes of running, so I figured I should try for 22. 
That took a little more work, but still not a long time. However, I think this is the best I can do. I honestly expected 22.9x to be my successful
22, but I got 22.69 instead. 

I like how easy the KG is on this map, really makes the run nice and simple.
