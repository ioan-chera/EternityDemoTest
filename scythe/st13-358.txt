Comments:  My 76th Scythe demo :)

           Another pre-breakfast session! And a very nice
           one. I have a lot of fun with this map.

           My first try was also my first exit. Annoyingly
           I was only practising there and didn't record.
           But it doesn't matter, it was about 6 minutes.
