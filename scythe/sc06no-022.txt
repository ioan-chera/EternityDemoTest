Ah, one of my favorite maps in Scythe. It's open, nicely designed, and a fun
breeze to run through. This is one of those maps where it'd be hard for me to
get impatient playing it because it's short and the wide open start is almost
impossible to screw up. The ending is what stopped 95% of my attempts, but I
didn't mind because the ending looks cool, too!

I'm looking for maps to improve some of Cacatou's nomo demos.. some I just
can't beat no matter how hard I try, but this was easy. I got 23.54 on my 4th
attempt, so I knew I should try for 22. 22 was a fun challenge and took more
time to get, but it's not optimal. With better running and better movements at
the end, 21 should be easily possible. 20 is not out of the question, either.
