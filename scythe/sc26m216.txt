Yes I did get like 30 runs with this pace before but revenants do not want to teleport! Also this was a completely mediocre pace (opening doors and nobles clean up downwards) but if you have like 0 barons alive up stairs then it's gg. My goal was 2:15 but I do not have more time to grind this need to do others maps.
