Comments:  This is two seconds faster than the UV Max record,
           which is mainly the result of lots of help while
           fighting the cyberdemon.
           Could be better though, because of bad aiming with
           the SSG and other mistakes. But it's ok for a first
           entry. My second best run is a 2:53.
