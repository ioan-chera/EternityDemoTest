Comments: Significant improvement over tatsurd's time, though it's still just a first exit and the route could be more aggressive of course, and I exited with quite a few rockets. It was a rather difficult map for -fast for me, though; even with this route, the start and the cyber fight is quite deadly (though this is the first attempt that made it to the cyber fight). Sub-3 minutes would be nice with this route, dunno what a really good time would be, though.
