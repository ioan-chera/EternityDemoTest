Comments:  An improvement of my 35:41 demo has long been
           overdue, but I wasn't able to do it during the last
           six months. I tried it a lot in October and November,
           spent dozens of hours with it (much more than 1000
           attempts I think), until I completely burnt out.
           This is the reason that I didn't record anything for
           a long time (except some testing for Gusta's new
           maps). Well, this week I felt I could try it again,
           and finally had enough luck to get another exit.

           The demo is not great, except the first 6 minutes.
           I have a lot of practice with this part and am now
           able to play it much more aggressively than half a
           year ago. And I had insane luck with infights, but
           not only in the beginning :)

           On the other hand under 30 minutes was possible with
           more aggressiveness and better planning later on, but
           I lost a few minutes with senseless running around
           for health. *sigh* My bad memory. I'm getting old :(

           I hope you like the demo though.

           It plays back with doom2.exe, eternity, prboom+ 2.4.6
           (using timedemo, fastdemo at least ;)
