Demo entry #8.

Description:

This map is a great ending to this powerful episode. Level is a bit too short
for my taste, but switching to Tyson mode really gives the depth and challenge
to it!

My demo was recorded before Gusta's entry, and i reached this first exit after
a surprisingly little number of hours. Not all parts of this demo are quick, but
I'm just happy with the time (my target was 4:59 or less).

Anyone for under 4:00? :-)
