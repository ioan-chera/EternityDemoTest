Comments: Much cleaner movement than my 20 second demo; the movement here is similar to map 21 with the non-orthogonal staircases and walls, except, thankfully, much easier to get an improvement. 18 is probably not feasible without incorporating some of the tricks, but I couldn't get the glide to work quickly (and it doesn't save much time anyway), and the death slide still seems impractical non-TAS (and, once again, it doesn't save much time as getting the rocket launcher requires a detour).
