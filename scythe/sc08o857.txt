Comments: Awhile back I did .91 with a safer jump and didn't want to try for a Kimo style jump for some reason. I didn't release the demo because I found it stupid that it would be slower than Pacifist. It's not that hard, really, as restarting the demo is pretty quick, so I tried to take it down to a reasonable centisecond time, and .57 is good enough.
