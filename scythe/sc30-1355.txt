Episode 1: Not completely happy with the episode 1, but really up to this point it simply wasn't worth
resetting every failed map 6 trick considering how often you fall dead on 21-22. I know many runners
who basically quit from the 21-22 gauntlet.

Episode 2: Alright, I run into some trouble on a few maps and of course miss the damn AD RJ.

Episode 3: This is where the run excels, strong times on essentially every map and very clench moments
especially on 22.

A great 58 second improvement. Next goal is 13:00-13:20 in my eyes for the scythe run.
