Description: 
The first optimal demo that I've done :)

I was looking to improve my movement with doing some nomo runs to see how 
good my time is compared to some of the really optimized ones. My first exit
below 20 seconds for this map was 19.43 I think, and from other maps I've
practiced I figured there had to be some 0.5 seconds for about every 20 seconds
I could gain with a lot of effort. 

After a while I was really in doubt if I could make it since it took a long
time before I actually got below 19.5x again, but eventually I got lower 
and lower times after resetting on the smallest things that went wrong.

That switch is the single most annoying thing about this map, it's so far into 
the wall so you have to stand quite close to it, and it's right after the door.

I was very surprised to see 18.97 on this one, I felt there was a couple of mistakes
that would put it just above 19, but it was enough fortunately.
