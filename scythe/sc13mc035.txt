4shockblast:

This was pretty fun. The keygrab setup is quite useful here, gives me a chance to open up all the map really early. I don't get much armor or health, so survival is a bit tricky, but not that bad once I get a good handle on the route. I didn't have much use for rockets, so I just grab a few to help with the start, and I use them all up so I can get to SSG after for the demon at the YK. Afterwards, just rush the ending so I can BFG the ending. My side was relatively quick, but I could do the BFGs quicker at the end, though it's hard for me to know what direction to use up the final shot. Either way, this time, I had enough time to hang around the exit for a bit, timed the switch well too, so, good time I think.

It's overall a pretty fun map to do. The route was modified quite a bit to prevent myself from BFG-ing 4shock, and it does work out pretty nicely. Luckily the skybox doesn't eat the whole BFG ball, or I'll have to reset for that missed shot.

All SSGs are just floor hazard to me since I don't want to get weapon switched, and the SSGs are not even useful due to the MP BFG.

I got blocked in front of the Soulsphere, and it was a bit sloppy to clean up the final monsters. Other than those, it's pretty clean on my side.
