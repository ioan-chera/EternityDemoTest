I wanted to leave no comment originally, because words can't properly describe
how trash this map is in tyson, but I guess I can try.

Imagine a heap of trash. Now imagine it's life hazard trash from an oncologic 
unit. Now imagine that it's so gigantic that you have to develop your own NASA 
program to properly dispose of it by hurling it into the atmosphere of sun, 
because sharing the same planet with this horrible trash is already harmful to
everyone dwelling on it. Hopefully that should give you a sufficient image as 
to how trash this map is.
