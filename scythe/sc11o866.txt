Comments: Making this to show slightly different death slide movement; by doing it in motion, 8 happens almost every time, although it is slightly more risky since it's possible to miss the exit. This was done in my episode 2 nomo for 8 seconds, though I probably won't attempt in a full nomo movie. Faster than my previous demo in terms of centiseconds, though I didn't optimize much as you could probably tell from the bumps.
