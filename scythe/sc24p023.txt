Comments:
jongo says this trick comes from method, so I guess credit goes to both of them. :)
The run was in my todo list for at least a year, but that little step jump is pure
madness, the rj is trivial in comparison.
Maybe I improved generally a little bit, it didn't take that much grinding today.
It's also an all-in thing, any mistake means a failed run, that's why the 1st exit
looks polished already. So glad it's not a low 24, heh.
