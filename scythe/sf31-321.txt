Comments: 
I'm the very determined, as said in my previous txt file for this level :P.

Took me lots and lots of attempts to get a demo that I was satisfied with.  Started with a 3:26, thought that was ugly, got a 3:25 a little later, though still ugly, then took me god knows forever until this run came.

I just played far more aggressively throughout the level, trying not to have any slow spots crop up.  The first 2 mancos are dealt with in a more aggressive and speedy manner.  Everything else remained the same, just sped up some.

Some bad SSG aiming in a couple spots, and a bit of bad luck at the YSK since one HK broke off from the group, meaning it didn't take splash dmg from the rockets I was using to clean out the barons/HK there.  Ah well, can't have everything go right in a demo :P.

Still, it's 12 seconds faster than my previous run (Which I actually thought wasn't that bad :P).

A time though below 3:20, probably even 3:15 or better, is reachable for those with lots of patience.  Not me right now, this map ain't my friend at the moment :P.  Gotta check out more undone UV -fasts here.

Once again as well, great map to record on.
