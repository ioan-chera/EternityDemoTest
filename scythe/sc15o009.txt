Running this map is both fun and agonizing at the same time, but imo a little more fun. :) I got many 10.1x and 10.0x before this. I think that this time I handled the
teleporter area a little better than my other attempts, so that's why this one is 9.

I doubt 8 is possible without using SR50. This demo is SR40 only. 

It was good to finally beat 10s! :) Enjoy!
