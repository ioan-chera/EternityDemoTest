Comments: Uses the double bar open trick to get down to 50. At first I didn't want to run this, as I managd to get a low 51 without it and it looked very good, but recently I thought to use that trick to get it down to 50. A rather silly way to beat GrumpyCat's nomo, but I still needed to get a pretty decent-looking demo for 50. Pretty certain 49 isn't doable without TAS.
