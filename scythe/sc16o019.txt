Comments: Thought this would be a lot harder. Only about 1K attempts. Just going extra hard on all the movement helps. The church pew jump credited to depr4vity, but I think it's probably possible to get 19 without it? Would just need really clean curved hallways, although these were decent already. confused recommended using LMB use; that helped a lot with getting fast switches. Otherwise, this would be much less fun.
