Comments: Wasn't even very interested in getting an exit at all at first because of that step jump. Soon, I found that the positioning in this demo is pretty likely to generate a successful jump, so, eventually, I got 22.97 first exit. Eventually I managed to get this run, another .97 :). Not great strafe50 at start, but whatever, improving this would be hell.
