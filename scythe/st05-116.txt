Comments:  My 75th Scythe demo :)

           Did a lot of runs between 1:27 and 1:35 during
           the last two hours. I knew I could do it under
           1:20. Finally this happened. It's not bad, but I
           lost a few seconds at the berserk pack.           

           It seems that a time below maxtime is possible,
           especially when quitting the armor.
