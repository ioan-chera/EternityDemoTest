Description:

	The 3rd episode is definitely the easiest one.
If there weren't the first two maps i would probably
keep trying to get a better time as there are quite
a few thing that could have been done faster and could
look better but on the other hand there are some good
moments too so this will be the final version for now
___________

Map21 - As i mentioned, this is the worst map in
	the whole wad, imo. 13 is not the greatest time
	but i really used almost every exit on this one

Map22 - The revenant band and of course the cybie can ruin
	many great runs

Map23 - Equaling the maps record time in a movie
	is always cool i guess, even if it's completely
	luck based like here ;)

Map24 - Probably the main screw up. Most often there is no
	problem picking up the blue key. Those pigs behind
	the cyber always block me (and it's important not
	to make noise so that the mastermind doesn't wake up)

Map25 - Another 2 or 3 wasted seconds at opening the orange 'door'

Map26 - The legendary map; I used a slower but safer route.
	If I ever do another version of ep3 i should try
	the usual one as it's noticeably faster

Map27 - Second time ever i managed to make that jump at
	the first try ...and that's all what this map is about ;)

Map28 - I've never liked this map too much and if you ruin
	the whole movie by falling into lava in a map with
	almost no monsters you cannot feel good ;)

Map29 - Manipulating the archvile can take some time here...

Map30 - Just a routine run.

	Shame there aren't any more scythe episodes
		 ... but thank you Erik for these three anyway ;)
