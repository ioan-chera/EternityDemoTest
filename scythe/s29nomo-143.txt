I was looking at my Scythe nomo runs and decided that this one could have
a little time trimmed off, so I made a few runs until I came up with this
one (I bumped into too many things in the others), which has four seconds
taken away. I needed to backtrack because I thought one switch opened some
bars, but another did. Overall, I think it's OK. I could try this for under
1:40, but for now I'm done.
