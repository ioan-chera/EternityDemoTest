I  mostly followed tatsurd-cacocaco's route, but I jump from rk area instead of using the door to get to plasma secret.  I got a few demos in the 1:34-1:40 range, but always with some slowdowns.  The main reason this attempt was so much faster is the nice rev grouping just before I go into the bk area.  I've also never left the vile alive, so I'm glad that didn't really cost any time.  267 attempts.
