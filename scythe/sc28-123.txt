Notes: My best run had been 1:27.54 for a while and it was very rare to get set up for the lineskip as quickly as in this demo, so despite the collision with the wall near the end, I don't believe it is worth me trying for a faster run overall.
Thanks to PartyCrasher for finding the lineskip initially, and Starduster, whose instructions helped me execute it in training. I then adapted those instructions according to what felt more repeatable for me. When playing slowly and carefully I have a high success rate (well over 50%) at skipping the line, however rushing for the speedrunning became quite frustrating.
