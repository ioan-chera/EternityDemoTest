Finally!...
I don't know what to say, this has been such a long grind.
The key grab at the start is very random because of the revenants.
I chose to get past the AV in the BFG secret since it works most of the time.
I played the last building pretty safe because I really wanted this exit.
Thanks to JCD for the cyber linedef skip :)
I might continue the grind, as sub 2 is really doable!
