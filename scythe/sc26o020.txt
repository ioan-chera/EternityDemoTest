Comments: I tried for 20 earlier in the year and came to the conclusion that it was probably possible but I couldn't do it. A few weeks ago, I decided it was definitely possible (managed to get a 20s run with segments). Didn't take too long to get a 20s run, although it's not too easy, as I needed to have good timing for the lowering platforms. Just for fun, I did a strafe40 only run, not optimal but I did match my previous DSDA run which uses strafe50. :D
