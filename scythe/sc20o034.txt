Comments: This was pretty clean; even though there's a slight messup on one of the pillars after the blue key, 33 does not look possible. I also got pretty lucky with the long fall at the end of the run, as I didn't slide alongside the wall and was able to just straferun forwards into the final teleporter (which is probably what got me the 34).
