Comments: Only took 43 attempts, largely just wanted to incorporate the BFG linedef skip into the run, and all I wanted is sub-3. Some mistakes with weapon switches at the start, could have used more rockets at the end since I had a good BFG shot at the hell nobles at the yellow key, and a bunch of missed shots, so there's a bunch of room for improvement. Of course, if you really wanted to optimize, you could do the BFG grab setupless with just a thing boost, but that would be absurdly annoying. :P
