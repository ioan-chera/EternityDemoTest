Comment: Decided to return again to this map again in preperation of grinding out D2ALL runs. Not a large departure 
From my last run's route just some small changes in the route including a more ballsy start. About 400 attempts in I
got a 2.46.89 run that absolutely sucked. It was very sloppy, I missed a cyberdemon point blank 6 times in a row with
the bfg and I thought that this was too embarassing to be the run I would post with 3 seconds of improvement. So an 
additional 600 attempts later and I got this run and goddamn it I could have done better if not for that accidental line
skip at the end. Oh well, it is definitely improvement and messing it up so much and getting only slightly worse than
this time shows I got more time to save, but for now this is satisfying. Besides, this laptop is failing, and losing
runs cause the spacebar doesn't register and thus I dont flip a switch or open a door really sucks.
