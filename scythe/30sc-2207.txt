Map: Movie 1-30
Source Port: Chocolate Doom 1.7.0
Time: 22:07

Map 1: 0:12
-0:11 is preferable but I didn't feel like it was worth resetting over a 0:12

Map 2: 0:23
-Considering im going for the armor due to map 3, 23 seconds was my best time for
this route.

Map 3: 0:34
-One of the most frustrating maps in the entire mapset of scythe, very easy to get blocked
by pinkies or just simply killed by shotgunners. Even with the armor, death came swiftly.

Map 4: 0:25
-Got held up a bit in the end section.

Map 5: 0:34
-Most of this map is cut out through SR50 over the middle area. Spectres would often block me 
on the second crossing.

Map 6: 0:28
-Happy with the time here, no real hold-ups.

Map 7: 0:04
-It's below 0:05

Map 8: 0:30
-This map was much more consistent by killing the mancubus off the start rather than later. Though
it is definitely possible to skip killing him as well.

Map 9: 0:35
-Get the red key without any blocking from the pinky/shotgunner. Solid time.

Map 10: 0:16
-Average run through an easy map.

Map 11: 0:39
-No complaints about this time. Those rockets on the hitscanners are way too satisfying.

Map 12: 0:35
-Should have used the chaingun rather than the rockets on the mancubus, bad weapon usage.

Map 13: 0:53
-zzzz I get the red key before triggering the stairs. More lazy Dime play.

Map 14: 0:49
-Not sure why I grabbed the green armor, felt unsafe I suppose. This map has amazing flow.

Map 15: 0:31
-Should have had sub 30, but I fell off the yellow key area....

Map 16: 0:38
-Burial grounds caused many resets, low health at the end of this map was especially bad for 
book lords.

Map 17:
-Major time loss in this map by not hitting the arch-vile jump into the exit. This map along with
17 was the cause of most resets outside of episode 3.

Map 18: 0:42
-The glide was mostly to try and induce some infighting to keep the mastermind off myself.

Map 19: 1:10
-Archvile pays no heed to doom guy.

Map 20: 1:10
-I couldn't believe how often I skipped over the trigger on the ledge with the blue key.

Map 21: 1:03
-Such a frustrating map. Can be done much quicker, but the amount of resets by imps blocking or a
lost soul made me play it safer. 

Map 22: 1:46
-The most difficult map in the scythe run in the route that I used imo. Damage taken is ridiculous
when there is no armor. Cyberdemon also plays nice by not giving me a farewell shot.

Map 23: 0:04
-Arch-vile jump goes well for once in this run!!

Map 24: 1:07
-Cyberdemon fight on this map is pretty nervewracking with 50 monsters on your ass.

Map 25: 0:36
-Positioned myself too far left and missed the gap once.

Map 26: 1:30
-After becoming so used to more modern sourceports, it was odd to play this one with the limitations
of chocolate doom. The 

Map 27: 0:48
-A deserved break map after 26.

Map 28: 0:32
-I am not a fan of Run From it's map placement. Too much adrenaline from Fear! Luckily
terror is in between the two. I have no idea how I survived, I was about to call it quits
after the revenant blocked me in the final turn.

Map 29: 0:56
-Somehow missed the arch-vile in my peripheral vision. I found it much easier to use the
arch-vile from the starting area over the blue armor arch-vile for the jump.

Map 30: 0:51
-WOW, I took barely any damage in this map. I went with the shotgun because I was terrified of
getting a map error. It has happened before zzzzz.


Shoutouts to Dew for individual map help and Graim for his unreal episodic runs. Hopefully I can
improve this to sub 20 mins eventually!
