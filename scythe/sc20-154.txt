Comments:
Kind of lazy demo. It can go lower (I didn't play as aggresively around cyber as I could have), but I don't like the map very much.  One strat I tried was to leave the hellknights alive and than shoot rockets up into the window later, but they don't always go by the window and it ends up being slower.
