Description:

I started running this level on Nightmare in late April 2010 to have some fun,
as well as to test my running skills. And at that time I was glad to just get
0:29 with hard work. Kimo's 0:28 seemed completely out of reach for me, because
of keyboard's turning speed limitations. But I didn't know that my movement
efficiency will still keep slowly getting better in future months: my angles of
straferunning will become more effective, my timelosses during turns will get
less and less.

In late September 2010 I returned to this level, and saw that the 29.00 mark
became breakable for me. Pulled out 28.94, and thought it's the best I can get.
At that time I also made the first NM100S demo for "Run from It", 0:30.

But today I understood, how naive was my claim in SS28-030.TXT:

"Don't expect 29 from me, I can just barely get 28.94 in regular NM Speed (while
Kimo's record is 28.86)."

After some more progress (as well as determining exactly where to turn at which
angles, where to strafe50, etc.), I managed to pull out some results which would
be unbelievable for me in 2010:

- 0:27 in nomo;
- 28.57 in regular NM (this little demo is attached as well);
- and finally, 29.74 in NM100S.

My new run still contains some crappy gametics, like bumping at demons, but has
rather intense SR50'ing (the Strafe50 ratio shown in LMPDET is over 60%).
