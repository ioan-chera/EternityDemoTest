Comments:  Yeah, that was great! After almost 9 months I returned
           to my favourite map. Thanks again to Erik's genius for
           creating it :)

           I improved the time by 48 seconds, because I've changed
           in my prboom.cfg the setting monster_avoid_hazards to 0.
           Thx to TheHappySpoon for this information in the DW forums,
           and to Anima Zero for proving its use in a real demo
           (ks08-600).

           Now the revenants at the crusher/teleport react correctly
           and there is no desynching after pressing the crusher switch
           as 9 months ago. I'm now able to run to the switch as
           fast as possible, therefore the huge improvement.

           Enjoy the demo :)
