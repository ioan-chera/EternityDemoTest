Comments: This run was also somewhat annoying, probably because it was one of the later ones I did. Also, like map 19, it is fairly unremarkable, and the lifts aren't particularly fun to wait for either. 34 is probably possible with a wallrun to the yellow door and ideal movement, but, like map 19, I'm not too interested in improving it. Also included demo where I skip the linedef that raises the wall after the blue key.
