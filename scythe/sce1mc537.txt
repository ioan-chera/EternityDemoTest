Map01:

[B]
Definitely the kind of map that's better to sometimes take a slower run on, it's otherwise incredibly frustrating to try to go for good times here, too much RNG. :^)

[G]
Nothing changes. The same good old average 17.

-------------------------------------------------------
Map02:

[B]
Pretty fast on both sides, so I didn't have much to do at the end.

[G]
Did help a bit with some extra monsters to even out the time, but honestly I can go a bit quicker to save 1 more second or so.

-------------------------------------------------------
Map03:

[B]
This one went quite well overall. I experimented with not using BFG shot and berserk here, but it's just a pain to kill things however you do it, and the BFG is overall helpful I think, so kept it in.

[G]
This is a better overall performance, but this is one of those annoying maps that is not very fun to play.

-------------------------------------------------------
Map04:

[B]
Pretty good time, I get smacked on my way to the exit by Garrett's SSG, but hey, no real harm done. :^)

[G]
Better weapon swap but I guess the Spectres wasted some time there for the other side.

-------------------------------------------------------
Map05:

[B]
Probably can do a bit faster with SSG at the end here still, but it was decent. Gained back the no BFG shot time later anyway.

[G]
This is a minor change of the route, which I took a bit extra time to kill Spectres down the trench. +2 isn't really a lost because an extra BFG shot is saved for later.

-------------------------------------------------------
Map06:

[B]
Not much happened here, I think my side was fine. There's quite a bit of variance in how fast monsters die, so this is probably good enough.

[G]
My side doesn't really have variance so it's all the same :P

-------------------------------------------------------
Map07:

[B]
Yeah, I screwed up a bunch on this map, could probably save more time. The monsters here always give me trouble. :^)

[G]
The Map05 tweak is meant for this map, but funnily, we didn't save enough to cover the loss :P  However, I think if this map is done nicely, it should definitely save more than 1 second.

-------------------------------------------------------
Map08:

[B]
Overall decent, though I was fumbling a lot. :^) This attempt came early in our new stream, so there were some things I wasn't quite used to yet.

[G]
This is just in general better knowledge for the remaining monsters so we don't need to panic over missing a kill or something.

-------------------------------------------------------
Map09:

[B]
Even more fumbling than map 8, can definitely do a lot more here, but I didn't quite take the right path through the map. Oh well.

[G]
This is way better planning in searching for remaining monsters. There are a couple of general spots I can go and search for stragglers so they won't end up wasting a bunch of time like the previous 5:45.

-------------------------------------------------------
Map10:

[B]
At least I realized the backup switch press strat, and it worked, but yeah, sad that I fell. :^)

[G]
Well, always the final map! Damn!
