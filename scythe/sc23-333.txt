Notes: Still not the time I really wanted, but after almost 6000 attempts this map has frazzled my nerves enough. A late change of strategy meant I was using extra cells and rockets in the mid section of the map, saving 3 BFG shots for the first cyberdemon before luring the second one out to infight, giving me extra cells from that point. In my previous method, I saved 4 BFG shots to kill both cyberdemons, but did the mid section more slowly. This strategy got me to a best exit of 3:39.14.
