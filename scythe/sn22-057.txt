Comments:  Tricky. It's possible to grab the BFG without
           waking up the PE - a very bad guy here.

           I needed about 150 tries for a first exit (1:29),
           after that I had more fun and 10 exits followed
           in the same amount of attempts. Second best was
           1:03.

           Now the last hole in the Scythe NM Speed table
           is Map32.
