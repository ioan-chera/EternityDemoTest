Once again, lots of tricks to do in a max = lots of resets. Wandering monsters is the biggest problem here, lots of runs just fail because something is missing and takes too long to look for. RL is a bit out of the way for Garrett and not that useful for me, I try to rocket as much stuff early since I have time, so it doesn't wander; sometimes the monsters are grouped up well and I can get everything dead quick, other times I'm not so lucky. This time was sort of in the middle; if I got better grouping and killed the demon, I could probably save Garrett more time at the end. Sub-50s would be nice.

My favorite part is that jumping through the window next to the Yellow Keycard. It allows me to skip both Yellow Keycard and Blue Keycard. Though, the problem is that, I need to BFG the Mancubus on the platform so it has a chance it will attack me and push me off. Then, monsters can stay near that window sill to block me.

Usually there'll be a couple of wandering monsters at the end. Took a bit of time to clean that up, but it seems it's very difficult to avoid this situation.
