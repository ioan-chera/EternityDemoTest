Comments: Not an ideal start, but everything else went well, RJ is pretty easy, actually, with this angle. I think 29 may be possible with a single-shot Romero, but I don't see it happening without that non-TAS, and, as far as I can tell, killing Romero in one shot is RNG, so I'm not going for that right now. Also included is a 31s demo that doesn't use the RJ.
