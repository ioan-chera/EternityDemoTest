Could be faster. The first challenge is getting past the chaingunner. Mainly because he shoots continuous shots, I try to take him out using what's there as fast as possible. Tried to get a demon to bite him, but it didn't work. :( The challenge then is trying to survive the rest of the map. I take the berserk so I don't search for health packs, and then run through the rest of the level.
