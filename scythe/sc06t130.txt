More route changes, which basically just directly translates to more yolo.
Using pistol against sarges was a little too irksome, so I figured I'd just
go ahead and punch through all of them. Reduces survivability to abysmal 
levels, but allows the part around crusher to be handled in a little more 
fluid fashion. I use the crusher just once, going for either 2 HKs and then
punching out third one, or just getting them all 3 crushed altogether. I
didn't bother going exclusively for one-time crush of all 3, because it's way
too unlikely given how unreliable the rest of the map is already. I didn't 
get it in this demo, so it could be something to consider incorporating if 
you want to go for this map and have too much free time on your hands.
