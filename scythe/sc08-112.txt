Comments:
tatsurd's 1:19 is pretty strong, I couldn't get close despite "rockets' behavior wasn't good"
for him. :) So I included the uv-speed jump into the route, which breaks the intended order
and allows for some wonderful infighting. It's much harder than it looks, though.

I make the jump just about once in ten, then it gets pretty dangerous standing between a HK
and a manco. This run is actually lucky, because Fatso got busy with imps and I just hoped
the HKs would join the fun without me there to goad them. When I got back to them, I couldn't
believe the slaughter, so I dawdled about needlessly. I got this exit after a pair of 1:16's
and some hard drill, so I'm content with the time, although breaking 1:10 is surely possible.
