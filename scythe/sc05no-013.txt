Comments:

I got this in 10 minutes. :P That said, this isn't the prettiest demo..
there are many tics still to be cut, maybe even a second.

It can definitely be a little bit faster if SR50 is used to perform that
jump from a shorter distance than one can do with just SR40 (and this is
a SR40 only demo, like all my normal demos). 

This'll just be up as the record until somebody gets a 12, I'm sure.
