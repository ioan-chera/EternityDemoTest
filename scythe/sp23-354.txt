Comments:  After grinding Map23 NM Speed I thought I would do the same with Pacifist. At the start of one of my attempts I mistakenly did the input for the SR50 before the screen melt started which canceled the mouse turn input and I ended up going diagonally into the teleporter. The funny thing was doing so seemed to cause the arch-vile to start his attack sooner than if I did an SR50 into the teleporter. I spent an extra tic in the starting room but the arch-vile more consistently started his attack as soon as I was in LOS.

Included is a -complevel 17 demo that's a bit faster to illustrate how important it is for PrBoom+ users to set the correct -complevel when recording demos.
