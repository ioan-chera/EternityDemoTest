I received a hint that this map is doable in tyson. It wasn't even particularly
difficult, but still an obnoxious excercise. The idea was letting cybers handle 
encounters slowly, not releasing new packs until all previously unleashed ones 
are completely cleaned out. This maximizes damage output to distant cybers. The 
main source of damage are constantly reviving archviles. Most of things are out
of player's control and you have to pray for good infights. I had to terminate
around 5 attempts that were over an hour in because infights were insifficient.
In case cyber horde manages to prevail, there is also an archvile right before
exit that can be unleashed for revenge and revive another hundred monsters, but
this time things went so smooth that this wasn't even necessary and I could just
pummel it. Even invulnerabilities that I kept to take out leftover cybers turned
out completely unnecessary.
