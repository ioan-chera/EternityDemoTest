Description             : You stand moments away from shutting down the final
                          demon spawner that would forever end this
                          tormenting struggle and bring everlasting peace to
                          the universe, but Hell has followed. You've
                          conquered endless realms, shattered their
                          realities, and killed them all more times than you
                          can count, but they've returned again, as they
                          always do. But, this time, it's their true last
                          stand. They think an assured victory is within
                          their grasp, the combined army of Hell's finest
                          against a lone survivor left with nothing more than
                          his fists, but you know better.
                          
                          It's 100,000 to 1.
                          
                          And they don't stand a chance.
