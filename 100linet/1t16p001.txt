Comments: LOL. At first, I was doing the strafejump and a long route with grabbing the red key by raising the platform below the lift. Then, I realized I hit the switch when I was basically outside the indented area, so I tried to just hit the switch without lowering the wall in front of it, and it worked easily... 0 seconds might even be possible with TAS running, but I don't think it's possible to turn that fast without TAS.
