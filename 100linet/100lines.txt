                          (that'll get you Capellan/Adam Windsor - use
                          Doomworld PMs to contact individual map authors)

Description             : The challenge was to put together the best possible
                          level that meets all 5 of the following criteria:
                           1. is Boom-compatible; and
                           2. uses only vanilla textures; and
                           3. is fun to play; and
                           4. looks OK; and
                           5. is constructed with 100 linedefs or less.

                          To put this last criteria in context, e1m1 has 486
                          linedefs.
                          
                          Over 70 maps were submitted, and 64 were OK'd for
                          release to idgames.  These have been split into two
                          wads:
                          
                          100lineT: is levels that are more or less 
                          'traditional' in their map design.  They may feature
                          special effects in their gameplay, but the focus is
                          on providing the standard style of play, just in a
                          very limited number of lines.
                          100lineN: is levels that tackle the 100 line limit
                          either by delivering a slaughtermap, or through the
                          use of an unusual (for Doom) style of gameplay.
                          Many of the levels in this wad are considerably more
                          difficult than any of the maps in 100lineT.wad
                          
                          All maps were designed with pistol start in mind,
                          though continuous play is of course possible.
                          The order of maps in the wads was determined by the
                          visual style of the levels; difficulty curve was not
                          a factor.  Some later maps will be easier than
                          earlier ones.  If a given map is too hard, too easy,
                          or just not fun for you, feel free to IDCLEV out of
                          there and try one of the others :)
