Description

Filed under violation of the trades description act, fear did not have a cyber and hence how can minimal fear have one :P
This map isn't too hard, I stay near the cyber when using rockets as you can usually clear the spectres with splah damage by doing this. Took one rocket like a boss though.
Bonus demo includes a moment of poetry where me and the cybers final rocket results in KO for the both of us.
