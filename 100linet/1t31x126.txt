Comments: Good wad for TAS since it allows for very aggressive play that's theoretically possible, but practically near impossible to achieve. Had a pointless chaingun shot in the beginning, but, somehow, it resulted in a better RNG with the chaingun, so I kept it in. Nice three baron kill with BFG (thanks to the cyber for weakening them). Also got lucky with the two archviles at the room with the blue armor; one of them died with the shot alone on my first try. Initially, I had a 1:27 on this map, until I redid the last room in order to kill the cybers in five BFG shots instead of six; took about 20-30 minutes to get that to happen, but saved a second.
