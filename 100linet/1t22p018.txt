Comments: Weird progression with my recordings in this map. I thought 0:25 was good
	  until I got a low 0:24, then a low 0:23 and so on. Finally I managed to get this
	  and since I feel like 0:17 would be really pushing my boundaries, I'm pretty
	  satisfied with the time. The BK and YK areas work very reliably with these tactics
	  if you time it right. The RK room is more problematic since everything depends on
	  the leftmost imps movements. I sometimes also broke the teleporter there, don't
	  know what's up with that since I had no problems with the other teleporters.
