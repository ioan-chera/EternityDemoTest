When I got 48.29 earlier, I knew this map could be improved. In the text
file, I said that probably under 45 was doable. I decided to try this map
again to improve my old time. Now that I have 46, I can say it would be
hard for me to get 45. However, there are many players better than I, so
I don't doubt that under 45 is still possible. It'd just take some more
work, or a faster route than what I show here.

Good luck to whoever tries this! It'd be cool to see an unassisted nomo
demo with a time of 44s or less. :)
