My favourite wad. It's the gift.
This is first wad where i had played on 'Brutal Doom' with skill 'Black Metal'.
It was hardest play but a lot of fun. I haven't used cheats and tried beat all maps. But i couldn't beat map30.
Not because i couldn't but because of these 'Afrit'. There are so many and it cause horrible lagging...
After deleting there all i could finish that wad in 'Brutal Doom'. It was one year ago.

About Run:
Amm.. Well... Somewhere i just copied Akse's movement. Nope... Everywhere XD.

About Complevel:
Every new attemps i'm finding something new about complevel. Suddenly make wallrun in any direction in '2' is very hard.
Because of this i lame in MAP07 and maybe in MAP29 because of that glide.

MAP07 and MAP29 are sucked. If i asked help for these tricks on Doomworld i guess final time could be 17:00

About MAPS:

Difficult for run:
QS - Quite Simple
PH - Pretty Hard
HAF - Hard As F###

MAP01 - {QS} Nothing interesting.

MAP02 - {PH} Nothing interesting.

MAP03 - {PH} Copied trick by MD922. Was a little hard.

MAP04 - {QS} Nothing interesting.

MAP05 - {QS} Nothing interesting.

MAP06 - {QS} Nothing interesting.

MAP07 - {PH} Here i found that without XDRE make RJ with wallrun impossible + in '-1' complevel i can make this RJ
Without any problems. Huh.

MAP08 - {QS} Nothing interesting.

MAP09 - {PH} Second attempt. 

MAP10 - {PH} Here i ignored AV jump because i couldn't survive in revenant crowd.

MAP11 - {PH} That glide is annoying.

MAP12 - {PH} Nothing interesting. Just lucky.

MAP13 - {PH} Nothing interesting.

MAP14 - {QS} Nothing interesting. Beat this map without segmenting.
So so so easy.

MAP15 - {QS} Nothing interesting.

MAP31 - {HAF} - Shit. Because of these 'Evil Marine' shooting without stopping i couldn't make RJ.

MAP16 - {QS} Nothing interesting.

MAP17 - {QS} Nothing interesting.

MAP18 - {QS} Nothing interesting.

MAP19 - {PH} Nothing interesting.

MAP20 - {PH} Nothing interesting.

MAP21 - {HAF} Well. Here i took Megasphere because i haven't enough health and because of 'skill 5'

MAP22 - {PH} How much i died before i could beat that map... oh Hell.

MAP23 - {HAF} First glide i made in 25 secs... Replayed and made it in 4 secs.

MAP24 - {HAF} Are you seriously? I can't make instant glide. I could make simple glide if i could stuck
but even this is impossible... Don't know why.

MAP25 - {HAF} Nothing interesting. Just suffering here.

MAP26 - {QS} Nothing interesting.

MAP27 - {HAF} I'm fooled with Cyberdemons because if not - that Afrit killed me in one shot.
Also i couldn't run away from Archvile in end. There are two of them and they catch me and burning my ass.

MAP28 - {HAF} Nightmare in Nightmare? How horrible it could be? Possible beat that map without TAS?

MAP29 - {PH} Can't make glide in such way.

MAP30 - {HAF} Couldn't decide which way is better: 'Akse' or 'dew'. I tried beat that map by Akse's way 
but I,m in anyway was smashed by Cyberdemons. Too hard dodging from 12 rockets, 28 caco's balls and over 200 IMP's balls.
.. oh yeah, These revenant's rocket with 80% damage....
So i used 'dew' route. And then i find out that i not picked up Rocketlauncher... Ou shit. A few tries and i found new route.

Thanks to MD922, AD_79, dew, Akse.
