Heh.. finally I was able to get 29. I got really lucky with the crate jump to YK this time; no catch on the pole at all. The best part is, I got this in about 20 minutes.
Well, this was the 5th day of attempts, each other day having 2 hours of fails... but it was well worth it. I'm very pleased to have a time under 30 here, with SR40 used
throughout the majority of the run.

Now, I was hoping to have a demo where I showed off a SR50 jump. It's right at the end. It's possible to jump over the bars as they're lowering, but very difficult, at least
for me. I had only gotten in about 3 past attempts, and those were like 30.0X endings because I didn't have a lucky YK jump and screwed up a bit elsewhere.

When I first exited, I thought I had made the jump; however, now that I've watched the demo again, I realize I wouldn't have gone over the last bars... so technically I
failed it. Oh well, still very grateful to have this demo.

27 should be possible with perfect movements, SR50 running, and a successful jump, I think.

Enjoy!
