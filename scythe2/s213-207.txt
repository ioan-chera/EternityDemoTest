Comments:  A few hours ago I had a random thought that I can't wait for the next episode of Scythe X. I just needed a dose of Scythe so I decided to improve my old s213-208, which was a first exit. And I certainly didn't expect it to be so hard... The final BFG rush is a total mess and there is a plenty of other things that can go wrong. I guess 1:xx would require a much better usage of BFG and maybe even some route tweaks.
