From s2no_dd95 text file:
"Under 1 minute would be very nice, but I don't think I can get it."

Was I really that much of a n00b back then? (Yes, tbh.)

I now consider this a modest demo. I just wanted one that looked semi-decent
that was also under 1 minute. I aimed for 58, but got 57 and I'm content though
I think it can be improved by 2 seconds with better running alone. I also
found a cool glide here while messing around (see the demo s222what.lmp). I
never seem to get glides that easy, so it was kinda weird, but very cool at
the same time. I don't think that glide has ever been used before in a speed-
run, but it would save a second or maybe more if one could get it instantly.

Anyway, nothing impressive to see here (well maybe except for that s222what
demo with the glide). I just wanted to improve the time and get it under a
minute is really all.
