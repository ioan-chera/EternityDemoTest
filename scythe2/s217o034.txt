When I got 35, I knew I could do 34 if I spent more time and put more 
effort into it. I wasn't quite satisfied with 35.31.

I started this map again, spent 40 minutes only to get high 35's and some
36's. I was sick of it so I took a break to help my Dad wash the car, came
back an hour later, started up again, and got this in 15 minutes. I like
how strange things like this can happen. :P

This run still has a few minor flaws, and 33 or maybe even 32 can be
squeezed out. A couple landmarks you should hit for getting at least 34
are: get on that ash floor by where the wall lowers to reveal the BSK by
the time 18 seconds rolls around, preferably in between 17 and 18 seconds.
Also, you should press that end switch somewhere around 29 seconds to allow
about 5 seconds for running up to the exit switch. You'll probably have to
be a little quicker than that to get 33 or below. Good luck if anybody
tries to beat this.

Enjoy!
