That first switch can go fuck itself. That light you shoot
for the first secret can go fuck itself. That jump to the
third secret can go fuck itself. If it weren't for those
3 things, I wouldn't have had to restart like 100 damn
times just for this exit because I missed or it felt
incredibly sloppy/slow.

I knew I could get 0:35 so I wasn't gonna stop just because
an exit of 0:36.06 happened. That was the motivation to get
this time.

Don't even bother with the Evil Doomguy, the crushing
ceilings do all the work for you, meaning you don't have to
directly hurt any enemy in the map. Which makes me wonder,
does this also classify as a Pacifist run?
