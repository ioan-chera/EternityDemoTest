Comments:  A few alterations from the UV-Max route, acquiring the green armor in the basement is essential to avoid being pummeled, I was very lucky with the AV and Cacodemon placement after acquiring the BFG, absolutely perfect line up and a huge payoff from all their nonsensical behaviour in failed attempts. It's absolutely essential to clear the Imps before taking the RK as it's literally impossible to drop down otherwise, the only anomaly were those Imps blockading the HK's, 95% of the time all Imps should be in the outer area, as a result I lossed a few seconds as I didn't have enough cells to use the BFG on the exit Mancubus but a very smooth run otherwise.
