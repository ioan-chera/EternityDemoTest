Category: nomonsters speed -- SHOWS A TRICK

I know this time is much slower than my nomonsters speedrun of this level, but
the main purpose of this demo is to demonstrate a trick I found on Scythe 2
MAP24. 

After becoming busy with school, and with mapping and demo-making taking up
much of my Dooming time, I hadn't played some of my favorite WADs in a while
(like 1monster and Scythe 2). I decided to explore the garden maps of Scythe
2 since I love their design. Erik Alm really made nice backgrounds and struct-
ures for these maps (especially--all his maps in Scythe and Scythe 2 are
great)! 

I came to MAP24 and remembered from watching speedruns that there was a secret
only meant to be accessed by an arch-vile jump. This idea came by accident 
while I was trying to record an actual nomonsters demo for this map. When
jumping out of the window after pressing the switch which lowers the pillar
containing the red skull key, I landed on one of the ledges by the start.
Because of my nature playing Doom, I decided to let that demo go and explore
the end of the ledge. That's when I wondered if I could find a way to jump
across the ledges and activate the invulnerability secret via ledge-hopping.
The jumps are quite easy, with none of them requiring SR50. (Though it really
serves no purpose, you can now activate that secret in nomonsters.)

However, the thing I wanted to show by making this demo is that with the ledge
trick, you can get the invulnerability whenever you like in a demo. I don't
know if it would be helpful in a UV-Speed to not have to rely on an arch-vile
jump to get the invuln or not, but I just found the trick kind of cool.

Also, please excuse my clumsiness.. I wasn't quite warmed up here. ;P
