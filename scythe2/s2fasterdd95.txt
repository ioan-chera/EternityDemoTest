WAD: Scythe 2
MAPS: See Below
Time: Various
Added Engine: prboom-plus v2.5.0.2
Category: nomonsters speed
Recorded on: See Below

Note: Thanks to Cacatou for making me want to return to Scythe 2 and
record some more demos for it that are better. :)

All demos use SR40 only unless otherwise specified (just like any other
of my normal demos).

Map title and comments:			TIME:

MAP01 (Castle Entryway):		OMITTED%

MAP02 (Rooftop Warzone):		OMITTED*

MAP03 (Castle Gardens II):		0:50.51
Comments: After seeing Cacatou's 3 second improvement on my old demo, I
thought it might be difficult getting 50. Sure, it took a bit of time, but
it didn't take as long as I had expected. I guess my old demos just really
sucked. :P Under 50 is definitely possible but I'm too lazy to try for it.
This demo is recorded with SR40 except for a small portion between the 12
and 13 second marks (where I use SR50 to help me get across that water).

MAP04 (Cursed Cellars):			0:21.94
Comments: I'm surprised Cacatou didn't try to improve more than he did on
this map. After 5 minutes of low 22's, I got this. All SR40.

MAP07 (Temple of Isis):			OMITTED^

MAP08 (Graverobbers):			0:24.34
Comments: Strange glide. I figured out it was easiest for me to do as I
glided in the demos. s208olol features a funny occurance since I did not
properly trigger a linedef after gliding. Cool map otherwise. :D

MAP09 (Valley of the Queen):		OMITTED%

MAP10 (Pharaoh's Tomb):			OMITTED*

MAP11 (UAC Base X):			0:19.97
Comments: Wow, very happy with this one. Expected to get more 21's and
a 20 about an hour later, but I got 19 now. To get 19 is tricky because
you have to have pretty good running in the halls by the YK (not too hard
to do) and not pause at the trick jump... at all (this is what is tricky!).
Now, because of this, you'll miss the trick jump pretty often, but don't
let that discourage you when you run the level. If you do it successfully,
it'll be faster. :)

MAP12 (Battleground):			0:33.94
Comments: Meh, I wish it looked a little cleaner for its time, but what
matters is that it's a 33. :) I think what helped was the bit of "rail
running" and bouncing off that switch which reveals the BK.

MAP13 (Mining Project):			0:37.91
Comments: With the jump trick by the red key, it's easy to get under 40
seconds. I got 38.91 on my first try today (tried 2 times yesterday then
had to eat dinner). :) Just from there is trying to bring the time down.
This wasn't too hard for me to do. I used a little SR50 to help the "no
door close" jump trick.

MAP15 (End of the Line):		OMITTED*
MAP15s (End of the Line):		OMITTED*

MAP16 (Mr. X):				OMITTED*

MAP17 (Canyon of Blood):		0:35.31
Comments: Too bad it's .31 hundredths of a second. You just have to not
bump into a lot of things, get the jump, and press the switch right after
the jump. More times than not, ironically, I failed when I made the jump
because I would fly right over that switch and land on the other side,
somewhere else. Fun map to run though. Very scenic!

MAP18 (Living Lands):			0:31.40
Comments: First successful exit, I got a 32.09. This irritated me, so I
had to bring it down to 31. Problem was, it's hard. It took a long time.
Other times were 32.06, 32.00, 32.03, 32.09 (again), and then just before
my success I got 32.77. Within a couple of runs after my 32.77, I got this.
I really don't understand how I can go from high 32 to mid 31 so easily
and quickly now, but not earlier. Weird, huh? :P I also don't know why
more people don't use the switch trick near the beginning. Sure, it's
annoying, but if you get it right away, you can save a full second at LEAST.

MAP19 (Withering Away):			OMITTED%

MAP20 (The Gates):			1:34.46
Comments: I got a lot of 1:35's before this, not surprisingly. Maps like
this where you have to run a lot without many stops are tricky and kind of
hard on the hands (for a keyboarder like me ;P). Idk what I did differently
here than on my other attempts, but this one is simply faster.

MAP21 (Doom Gardens):			OMITTED*

MAP22 (Garden Base II):			OMITTED*

MAP23 (Whispering Winds):		OMITTED*

MAP24 (Gaias Temple):			1:21.63
Comments: Cool, not sure how I got that linedef skip to work, but it did.
There are a couple slightly sloppy moments, but this is probably hard to
beat unless you also get the linedef skip and have perfect running (unlike
my running).

MAP25 (Forgotten City):			OMITTED*

MAP26 (Death):				OMITTED*

MAP27 (Afterlife II):			1:31.74
Comments: Long but very likeable map. First exit was 1:32, and it was kinda
hard for me to push it down another second. Unfortunately, even though I've
tried, I just can't seem to get this to 1:30. Maybe Cacatou or somebody else
could get 1:30 or even 1:2x? :)

MAP28 (Nightmare):			OMITTED*

MAP29 (Dust to Dust):			OMITTED%

MAP30 (Haunting Dreams):		0:48.29
Comments: Wow, 22 second improvement just by finding a better spot to fire
the rockets. :) This map can be done under 50 seconds after all! I bet it
could be done under 45, too, if you were very precise and patient, but I'm
neither one of those, so you probably won't see better from me.

Reasons for omitting runs:

% means that somebody else already has a better time for that map that
	I couldn't beat.
* means that Cacatou beat one of my old runs, and that run of his was so
	good I couldn't take back the record. :)
& means that Cacatou simply tied me or did not bother to beat one of my
	runs. No need for me to record a faster demo there.
^ means that I can't beat the map with the nomonsters parameter.

Once again, thanks to Cacatou for this motivation to play more Scythe 2.
You had some pretty good demos, man! I only beat about half of yours. Maybe
we should do this for some more WADs? :)
