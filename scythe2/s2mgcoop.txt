  Description: 
  We recorded these demos at Method's home, we had pretty much fun with playing it,
  I just remember that we hated map19 alot, it took us nearly 2 hours to do the exit.
  And map21 had some nice moment when Method is sawing and me punching mancubus simulta-
  neously. That's all which has been stucked in my memory :)
  The demos are more or less OK, all seen from Method's view. The mine one was probably
  lost somewhere. Press F12 if you wanna change among players' views
  Enjoy!
