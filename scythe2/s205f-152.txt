My second demo for DSDA, UV-Fast edition. Took a few tries and went a lot easier when I dealt with the pain elemental first. I have much less trouble with cybers on -fast since you dont play a guessing game when those fuckers want to let off a rocket. Props to myself for missing shots right in front of me, and playing hide and seek with a lost soul for too long.

-Wordy.
