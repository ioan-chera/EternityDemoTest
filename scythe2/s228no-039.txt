Comments:

Took a couple days (a few minutes less than an hour each day) to get this,
so I'm pretty happy with this. Probably if you use SR50 at some points, or
just run even better than I did, you could get 38s, possibly even 37s, but
I think that's pushing it. I don't see any significant wallbumps in this
demo (finally!), which I'm assuming got me 39. This is an SR40-only demo,
as all of my nonTAS ones are.
