Comments:  Major luck helped throughout here with nearly every encounter going smoothly as opposed to a huge RNG grind, usually I get slaughtered at either the SSG or after the Red key. It's amazing the secret Archvile managed to stay in the confines of his box otherwise it's a huge risk of being scorched by the distant Mancubi and wasting time trying to weave back and forth around the corner.

Another breakthrough was the Archvile in the inner sanctum after acquiring the RL, he's usually a tough nut to crack but he was slaughtered by an onslaught of infighting which was rare and took him down swiftly saving a great amount of time in an otherwise aggressive and dangerous situation.

I used too many rockets before acquiring the Yellow key, as the result their was a struggle with the Revenants but I pulled through without wasting vital seconds. I especially enjoyed the outcome at the end.
