My #1 entry for the International Beat a Cyberdemon531 Demo Week.

Going against the spirit of the festivities, I had to actually try to beat his time. Then I had a training montage, shook off several kilos of rust and had an unlikely comeback after everyone wrote me off. Also it's .97, baby! 30s would be a really slick nomo, but that would take effort.
