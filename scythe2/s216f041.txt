Comments:

That first switch made me restart more than anything
else in this map. Very anti-climactic as our evil
doppleganger counterpart doesn't seem to understand
plasma doesn't go through box corners. Oh well.

Sub 0:40 is possible and optimal with better running
and getting the first secret on the first shot. I
don't think that the fight with the Evil Doomguy could
go any smoother.
