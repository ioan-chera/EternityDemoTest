Comments: Such a good map...I use the trick from Akse's movie, although the execution is slow here =/.  Anyways, I get to yellow key 4 seconds faster than previous demo, yet end result is only 3 seconds faster so I'm missing a second somewhere.  I've tried to improve this, but the revenant trick is so annoying, and it seems like the times I make it are the ones where my running sucks at the beginning, such as here.  Luckily I had good monster cooperation or else I would have gotten slower than Ryan's demo.
