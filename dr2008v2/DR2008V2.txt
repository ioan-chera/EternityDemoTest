[3]Storyline
------------
2008 at last. Ready to kick back and live it up, you receive an emergency call to action from marine HQ.
Looks like your relaxation will have to wait. Contact has recently been lost with a secret underground facility
that specializes in weapons storage and long-distance portals. This scenario has hell written all over it. All
personnel are presumed dead and the facility presumed overrun. This is no rescue mission... it's a search and destroy.
Since you've lived to face the hordes of hell over and over, you get to be the one to stop them... again.
Prepare for Part I of Dark Resolution 2008!!!
