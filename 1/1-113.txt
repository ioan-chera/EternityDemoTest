Comments: Usual times here were around 1:14 or higher, it's merely luck with damage output and the monsters behind the cyber helping out (and noy dying to shotgun fire from the back). It's probably improvable, but it's very luck-based, and I'm not interested in a really long grind on this level. Included a demo that shows that the imp behind the cyber can open the exit door, which means that I can get additional help from the exit room imp on the cyber, but that's uncommon.
