Comments: Three short decent levels by p_corf. 8 might be possible on map 1, but I don't want to try it in a D2ALL run. 2 in 5 is probably optimal. 30s on 3 is also likely the best that one could get, but it is possible to get the elevator on a single cycle, which would save a lot of time. That's very precise, though, and I may be having mouse troubles right now that prevent me from turning too fast, so I'm skipping that trick for now.
