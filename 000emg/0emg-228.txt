Beat a Cyberdemon531 Demo Week

Map01 - 0:24
Map02 - 0:21
Map03 - 1:43

Map01 was a pretty average run. I've gotten 0:22 in attempts, but can't get that all the time.

Map02 probably could have been a 0:20 if I played it a bit more aggressively

Map03 is probably where my inexperience with uv-max shows a lot :p
I lost track of how many spectres I killed in the blue key area, and I kinda just winged most
of the map.
