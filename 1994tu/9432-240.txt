Category: NM Speed
Time: 2:40

Notes: Previous recording sessions included: elevators not working amongst some teleporter troubles. I was aiming for 2:30 at least. I didn't open a door before the switch (this consumed time) I got confused in the cyberdemon cage room (the one that has zombiemen not the mastermind one). A lot went wrong but I'll improve this.
