Comments: I found there is plenty of empty space in the zombiemen area, so you can run quite 
          directly to the door switch cutting that part in diagonal without having to follow 
		  all the perimeter of the room, similarly to nuts 2.

          A 38 seconds demo was rather unexpected - I didn't think the wallrun on the last 
		  wall could be that fast. Also, good exit switch press.
