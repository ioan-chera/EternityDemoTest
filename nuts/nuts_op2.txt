I was shooting for under 3:00, but this is really a hard run to optimize.
if you RUN it, then you will run out of cells... seems silly, but it happens every time.
so, you must get the backpack.  the advantage to this is that you never have to turn the bfg off.  :)

Actually, I wanted to do a rocket-launcher only demo.. but there is no rl.  Can't wait for HR2, then we'll see some dehacked map32 action. ;)

very easy to leave monsters behind in the first room when you play for speed.
cyber room is a very interesting place with the dehacked patch... how close do you cut those corners...  :)

It is really a shame that this has a distinct lack of sufficient ammo... I would've liked to have done a maxdemo.

play the demo back with Boom, unless you like directx frame-by-frame(or have a 2Ghz machine).
