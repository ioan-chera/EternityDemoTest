Seeing entryway suggest using GLBoom+ to play "Long Days," a WAD he posted
about in Doomworld, inspired me to try it with its inspiration, the notorious
WAD known as NUTS.  Eventually, I decided to try to break the current cheated
UV max record -- by which I mean the current UV max record attained by using
Greg Lewis's Super Weapons VIII patch included with DeHackEd 3.1. ;p  In the
end, I knocked ten seconds off of Opulent's record, but I didn't manage to break
3:00.  Maybe some other time... ;)
