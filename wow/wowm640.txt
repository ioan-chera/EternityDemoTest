Description:

Got the WR first try but perfecting the time took me a short while

No way this could be lowered

WOW!
----------------------------------------------6.40 TEXT UPDATE----------------------------------------------------------
Wow... I was playing this map on complevel 3 + -shorttics cuz i thought that maybe i could lower the time by 1 tic :^)
I accidentally killed the cyberdemon instantly with the second ball and not with the tracers of the second ball, I didn't know 
that the fastest way to kill a cyber was ball + perfectly aligned tracers + ball, i got a 6.46 and i was extremely surprised and
pissed off that i did not make a demo so i start doing recording attempts, with my first try i got a  6.49, really really lucky.
It took me a long time to get close and I finally got 6.40.

I mean it when I say seriously that this demo is frame perfect from start to finish, it's the first time I used double restart 
to make a frame perfect start on tic 1, I also made the right angle to pick up the BFG, the pistol was at its lowest point so 
the swap from the gun to the BFG was literally perfect, then I shot 2 frame perfect balls at the cyberdemon. I dare to say
that it is IMPOSSIBLE to lower this demo, I would be very surprised if someday someone would do a 6.3X demo.
