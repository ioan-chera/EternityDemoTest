For the Ultimate Doom pwad "wow" by Paul Thrussell
Recorded on a version (two bytes altered!) where it is possible to exit the map.

File required: wow_x.wad (included in this zip)
This zip also includes the original wow.wad and wow.txt

Map: E2M8
wow_x008: UV Speed/Max in 0:08
wowxN008: NM in 0:12
Two miscellaneous demos (wow_xheh and wowxNheh) where the player and the cyber both die, and the map doesn't exit.

These are Doom.exe-compatible demos (recorded with glboom 2.2.4).

Description: Some demos on one of the famously "worst wads of all time" (unmodified apart from two bytes I changed with a hex editor so that the map would exit when the cyber died).

Funnily enough, NM is easy. You get stacks of ammo and the cyber doesn't move around in its "illusio-pit" very much, so you can do it plenty of damage from outside. On UV, I think you just need to dive in. This is quicker, but has a poorer success rate.

If you watch the NM demos in Doom.exe, then you will see for yourself that "For some reason you can see the demon's head, when at a certain distance."

I'd never realized that on E2M8, the engine did a check for the player still being alive as well as for the cyber(s) being dead. "You learn a new thing every day."
