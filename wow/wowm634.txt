I read "No way this could be lowered" when I first saw 6.40
Today I finally learned how to 2 shot a Cyberdemon. It sucks.

I mean it when I seriously suggest that this demo is out of control
from start to finish, it's not the first time RNG has completely
fucked my runs, such incredible bullshit from the first shot,
to the cyber position, to the bfg damage, to the second shot,
the cyber's second move, and then the biggest kick in the balls 
of all, the end game RNG. I should've had this run earlier but
the end RNG fucked me ANYWAY I made the right angle to pick up
the BFG, the pistol was already gone when I picked it up, ugh
so smooth and perfect I moaned a little, then when I came up on
that cyber ass and 2 shot it with those 2 glorious green balls
it was DEVASTATING AUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

I dare say that it MIGHT BE POSSIBLE to lower this demo, I would
not be surprised if someone makes a 6.2x demo!
