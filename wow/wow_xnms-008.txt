Comments:  wow.wad is one of the most primitive levels I can imagine, but really I can't find myself harping it
as some other people since I find it pretty hilarious knowing why it exists. I mean heck, even Paul himself pretty
much knows the infamy of it, so well there's that. Anyways, I decided to see if completing wow.wad in under 10
seconds is possible on Nightmare, and turns out it is. If anything the only difference between Nightmare Speed and
UV Fast is the double ammo on Nightmare.
