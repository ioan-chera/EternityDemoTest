Comments: Level seemed somewhat fun from GrumpyCat's max, so I gave it a max too. Definitely prefer this to map 01, though it could also benefit from some plasma cells. Like map 01, this is a first exit max; about 30 minutes (maybe 40) spent getting this. Start is a bit hard to survive, but once I figured out the relatively safe spots, it became more or less straightforward. A lot of the time, I wouldn't get good runs because  the monsters wouldn't cooperate in the last area; this time, it went fairly well there. Still improvable, of course.
