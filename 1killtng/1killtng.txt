Angelo Jefferson                    thing to kill in all the levels

       There was hexen and hexen2, startrek and startrek the next generation,
quake and quake2. What do they all have in common? The sequel was a hell of
a lot better than the original which was good any ways. Well now theirs #1kill
the next generation which follows the tradition. It features 23 never before
seen levels with new textures and music from all off doom ever created 
under Id. It was built with the experience of building 13 levels for doom/doom2
and the experience of playing doom, doom2, final doom, obtic, hexen, 
swheretic, quake, and other levels off the net, These levels are built to be
challenging with the quality you would expect from Id, playability, and beauty
in mind.

Known bugs
Visplane overflow: happens in big open complex areas

prevention: save often When in the levels in question. 
When reloading after this happens don't look across the
full span of the room in which it ocuurs
has occurred but rarely in11,19,20 and in secret level 2

HOM effect: caused by too many lines in one viewing area. It dose occur in
some sky seens 
Effect: a hall of mirrors effect. when players walks away or turns the 
hom affect disappears dose not affect game play but distorts the appearance
can be seen in minorly in level 11 15 17
