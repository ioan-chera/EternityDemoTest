Description:

A rather nice map in a mapset which is not bad, but overall is not for my taste.
I had a few 2:45-ish exits with the megasphere, this is the second time I
decided to skip it (you would get some extra plasma ammo and 100% items/secrets
as well if you went for it).

At 1:16 I got a bit stuck on the imps - I include the slower no-megasphere demo
(2:32), in which this particular part is dealth with in a much nicer way (@1:26
of 1k16-232.lmp).
