Time:     5:20

Comments:	I had a bunch of runs around 6:10 which i thought were decent. Then i pulled out an amazing 5:45 but I left 1 monster behind
that was right in front of my face. Glad I did because a dozen tries later I created a better route which invoked better infighting
from the iron fatties. This run doesnt feel as fast as the others but infighting went great and I saved a lot of rockets for the final trap
because the archvile jailbreak went great.

BTW this map and its corresponding episode are by far the best imo.

*Note - If you leave too many lost souls prepare to eat your own rocket or get blocked in and take
a 12 ft stream of fire to the face at the red key trap.
