Comments:	This turned into a fun map to run...

If you dont fire you wont wake the chaingunners on the pillars or the monsters in the red key arena.
You can jump straight across to the Yellow key. Most my attempts failed either there or by the chaingunners near the 1st
elevator which is nice because its at the start. Invulnerability is not necessary i just got tired of the 2nd elevator chaingunner
owning me. Ive had several attempts where the AV jumped me over the crushers but i dont think its faster because you still
have to wait for the 2nd group of crushers to open.

Possible improvements...
I have several ideas but i havent been able to string them together into a single run. It would be nice to see someone 
try these. 
-After grabbing the yellow key you can quick turn onto the circle platform without flying over.
-In the red key arena it might be faster to go around the edges to the switches instead of jumping through portals.
-You can skip the invulnerability and long jump from the spider platform all the way to the center island.
-AV jump?
