REALLY happy with this one. This map is haaaard.
The tricky SR50 jump at the beginning took a bit longer to setup than I would have liked,
but it's a hard trick so as long as it's decently fast, I'm ok with it.
The other big trick in this is an AVJ at the end to go straight into the exit. Tons of
luck involved there since the enemies can block the teleport destination, they infight,
the archvile goes the wrong way, or he just doesn't like you that day.

I was originally going to submit a 1:04 that had gotten a green armor near the end
to help with the AVJ, but I decided may as well go all out and skip that too. Paid
off in the end :)
