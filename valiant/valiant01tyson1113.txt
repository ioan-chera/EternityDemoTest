Whew. The first Tyson demo for Valiant. Tyson and Valiant are an interesting combination. On one hand, you have a much more powerful pistol, but on the other, you've got much more deadly enemies. The imp's quicker fireballs are really difficult to dodge when in big firefights. This map is a decent map for tyson, you get a berserk pack and a chainsaw, what could be so hard? Well, mainly it was the end. Mancs, not a huge issue, just the Archvile. I had so many attempts where he would just run somewhere and I couldn't find him, then he'd blast me. Here, I had the idea to fight him near the lift, which worked nicely. Lots of goofy things happened in this demo, too, but hey, I won! Took about 45 minutes to get this. Time could be improved greatly if you tried hard enough. Under 10 shouldn't be too unreasonable...
