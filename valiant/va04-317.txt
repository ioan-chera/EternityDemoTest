Comments:  This is my first ever demo and speedrun attempt tbh. I hope i did this properly and everything works ok.
I really enjoyed this Iwad and I found this map to be a lot of fun to UV-Max.
There are many possiblities for strategic ideas and weapon usage. I had a few attempts around 3:15 but they were
sloppy pre-recordings. The success rate of getting to the first door was very low for me. I believe under 3 mins
is possible for a more skilled player. I might give this another shot later on...
