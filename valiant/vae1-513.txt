Various notes:
The rocket on the second group of imps at the end of map01 makes things a lot more consistent.

Still not entirely sure about plasma in map02, might be able to use rockets to get the
same effect.

You can wake up the revenant on map03 early by getting in line of sight, and then hopefully
bait him out and just go for the rocket jump.

Missed the blue key on map04. A first for everything I guess. This was probably the biggest
mistake in the run. Doing an AVJ to the yellow key might be worth it.
Also not shooting at the beginning of map04 prevents a ton of monsters from waking up, which
makes getting to the exit much easier.

Yellow key grab on map05 probably isn't faster, but it is a heck of a lot safer. Although I did
it really slowly this time around.

The red key bars tried really hard to end this run in map06.

Really glad I got the rocket jump in map07. I had a lot of health afterwards, and maybe I could
have skipped the secret, but I also needed the cells for the BFG anyway. Although I ended up
needing the health anyway because of the Cyberdemon...
