Right on time for Doom's 16th birthday is... a demo for another Fiffy map.
Well, I could've picked worse.  St. Lucifer's Church, the level I play in this
demo, is certainly improved over his previous WADs.  For one thing, he's visibly
scaled back his ammo-dispensing habits; although there's still a lot of
munitions, it's nowhere near as bad as it was before.  Not only that, he
/finally/ learned to use the grid!  As a result, all of the teleporters seen
this level are *gasp* /aligned correctly!/  And most of the secrets are at least
hinted at, although there are still a few that you wouldn't find without prior
knowledge (the door to the rocket launcher room's teleporter, for one thing.)
There's also some bouts of "what the hell did that switch do."  The level's
still not all that tough to deal with, but it's at least /slightly/ harder than
his previous levels.

Not much I can say about this level, other than that it's set to a MIDI
conversion of White Zombie's "Black Sunshine" (by Mike Slusher,) which at least
suits the adrenaline-pumping action of Doom (it's about a racecar, after all,)
unlike the song used in Satan's School of Warfare.  The first time I beat the
level (without 100% Kills or Secrets,) I got 12:06.  In unrecorded runs with
100% Kills and Secrets, I got 10:38, 10:14, and 10:05, which made me set my
target time to 10:00 or less.  Naturally, when I made my first recorded exit
tonight, I broke my target time by 22 seconds.  In every one of these cases, of
course, I beat the level faster than Maikl, who achieved 100% Kills and Secrets
on this level in /21:49./  Seriously, what the hell!?  I can understand being
a more laid-back speedrunner, but this is ridiculous!  Oh, well!  Now you can
see somebody beat this level without having to spend 22 minutes of your life!
The demo could go even faster if you handle the first part of the level the
daredevil way by running past the pews and the altar without firing a shot and
letting infighting take care of the patrons while powering your way through the
next room, but I haven't been able to get through it this way without dying.
Maybe some other time!

P.S. The textfile includes this note: "And don't forget Karl Martin who
proofread this long document for the millions of errors that wer [sic] in this!"
The irony of this statement should be obvious.  For that matter, the notion of
demons attending infernal church on /Christmas/ is either silly and hypocritical
(it's /Christ/mas, after all,) or one "Hell" of a coincidence! ;)
