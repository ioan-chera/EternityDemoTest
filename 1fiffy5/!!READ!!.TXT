 NEW IN AOL! The REoL TOUGH DOOM LEVEL HELPLINE! As of this writing, you
 will find the helpline under KEYWORD:PC GAMES. Select the MESSAGE BOARD 
 and go to the GENERAL topic. Look for REoL TOUGH DOOM level helpline!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         ***** NOTE ON GAMEPLAY *****

  For those of you who are picky about jerky levels, This level IS jerky 
FOR JUST THE FIRST TWO PARTS, in the church, and the marble room behind the
altar. After that, all runs pretty smooth! Give this level a chance! 
  Besides, DOOM II is about this bad animation-wise!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This game can be played in all modes. In 1 or multi-player games, you'll
all start out in the same open field outside the church. You'll start with
the lowly pistol. Your battle starts right away, so keep an eye out!
  In Deathmatch, you will start in one of numerous locations. BEWARE, some
of you COULD start close to each other! You could be in the same sector as
your friend(s), or "one away", so be prepared, ALWAYS!
  Also, you'll start off with a shotgun, rocket launcher, some rockets, and
a box of shells. USE YOUR SHOTS WISELY (my, how old)!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO PLAY THE NEW LEVEL

At the DOOM prompt, type:          DOOM -FILE FIFFY5.WAD

Level of Difficulty can be chosen, but expect a big turnout on Ultra-
Violence and Nightmare levels of difficulty!

I'M TOO YOUNG TO DIE! or HEY, NOT TOO ROUGH is like a regular church day.
HURT ME PLENTY is like the turnout for a religous holliday, like Easter.
ULTRA-VIOLENCE and NIGHTMARE is like Christmas. UH-OH!

   CPU REQUIREMENTS: A 486sx 20MHz minumum. Some areas of this game will 
   need it, but after the first few parts a 386 33MHz+ could even handle
   this! GOOD LUCK! IT'S TOUGH!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 STORY:

   It's Sunday morning, at least to your knowledge, and Satan is STILL
creating havoc on Earth! For now, you have another mission to accomplish!
   It's now Christmas Eve in the year 2194, and most of hell's creatures
usually go to church for a sermon of evil, and for a good night's sleep.
(Like real church, there will USUALLY be far more vacant pews than the
day of Christmas, or Easter.)
   You're heading back to Earth to see what's happening up there, when
you come across a church that does not exactly preach about God, but the
evil one, SATAN!
   Well, you decide to head into the church to see what this twisted
satanic religion is like, but as usual, you are not greeted quite too
well for interrupting the sermon. You work your way into the back area of
the building to find daemons galore on your tail. Once you reach the back
exit of the church, a door out of nowhere (literally) opens up right out
of the sky! You then realize that there is an invisible building on site!
You then realize that your adventure isn't really over, but has only JUST
BEGUN! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              PLAYING TIPS:

(1) GRAB THOSE SHOTGUNS! Do so before you enter the church!

(2) When you are in the green marble room behind the altar, you will find
    a switch that will lower the medical kits close to the ground. If you
    are still fighting enemies, you do not want to pick them up, or even
    stand on the platform because (blink!) LIGHTS OUT!

(3) When you enter the "back yard" of the church, a invisible door to the
    invisible building will open. Kill the enemies inside that room. If
    you fail to, you'll have a BIG job on your hands, or you will be sold
    as hamburger at the corner grocery store.

(4) In the church, there are stained glass windows. Some will open up and
    a passage way is found. To gain access to the pathway, stand on a
    nearby seat and run through the window openings.

(5) ARE THEY DOORS?: In the invisible building, you start off in a room
    with three pannels of moving, distorted faces. These are DOORS. These
    WILL NOT WORK by pressing the spacebar, otherwise, the animation
    would have to be sacrificed. To open the doors, walk up to them and
    STAND DIRECTLY "ON TOP" OF THEM. You'll trip a wire that opens them.
    On the other side of the doors you MAY not need to worry about any
    tripwire to open them....

(6) SECRETS ARE SECRET: Trying to find the secrets? GOOD LUCK! The all-map
    cheat will NOT display them, so you are on your own! Hey, I warned you
    that you'll never find them on the map again, since the level REoL
    TOUGH: The Pit. (Heh, heh, heh!)

(7) RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!: There are two places in this level where trying
    to kill all the enemies is pretty much a stupid idea (unless death
    sounds good to you). One word: RUN! This especially holds true near
    the exit.

(8) SUPRISE!: There are a couple of "suprises" behind the blue-keyed door.
    Perhaps you may want to know, or maybe you don't....

(9) "HIDDEN SWITCH": There is a switch somewhere in the level (not in a
    secret) which you do NOT want to hit if you want (or have access to)
    the BFG-9000.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known "Boo-boo's":

(1) HALL OF MIRRORS BIG-TIME! (SOB!): When you open the door to the
    church, depending on where you stand, you will experience the dreaded
    HOM EFFECT. This is because (now I REALLY know why) there are WAY TOO
    MANY linedefs (not sectors) on screen at once. Too much detail for
    the darn game to draw! This happens when you stand on the altar
    as well. I think there's a 100 linedef limit, according to sources.
    (For you who don't make your own levels, LINEDEFS = PLANES.)

(2) "MISSING" CORNER OF BRICK RETAINING WALL: On the leftmost corner of
    the brick retainer wall, on the church side overlooking the lower
    courtyard, you'll notice a corner of the brick wall that is
    "missing". However, on the other side of this wall (a good 30 feet
    lower than this viewpoint), this corner IS visible. I guess the
    "engine" of this program has a couple bugs that ID SOFTWARE did not
    know about (they didn't attempt anything difficult like this)!

(3) ENEMIES SEE THROUGH STAINED GLASS WINDOWS: If you're outside the
    church, looking at the far end of the building, enemies inside the
    church will come out after you. If you look at this level with an
    editor, you now know why the enemies in the church are facing in the
    weirdest of directions.
