Description:    I consider this to be one HELL of a level.  Meaning you can 
                play this for a long time and not win.  However it makes 
                a great deathmatch.  I made the hard skill levels (4 & 5)
                look a little more hellish, because the easy skill levels
                are a cakewalk. I figure it to be a cheap reward. I've 
                included a .LMP of me beating (finally) the level on Ultra-
                Violence, but haven't tackled Nightmare yet.

Bugs:           NO! I made it moron proof.  You can even jump behind the
                giant lifting wall and get out.

Programs Used:  DEU 5.21, DETH 6.3 (buggy, yet better), BSP (I don't
                remember what this is called. I just type in BSP)

Episode and level:      E3M1 (The sky is a lot cooler in this one)

Single player:          YES

Cooperative 2-4 player: YES (not tested)

Deathmatch 2-4 player:  YES!

Comments by Author:     Well, all of the work was done on a Pentium 100
                        with 16 Megs of RAM, so I'm not sure whether it
                        will slow down or not.  This one was tested on a
                        486DX2-80 and a 386DX-40. (!!!) Many thanks to
                        ^^^^^^^^^       ^^^^^^^^ (corresponding computers)
                        Sean Birkel and Ben Gates.  They pretty much told
                        me ALL of my bugs and helped me test it out on 
                        modem play. (These two have made levels more
                        complex than ANYTHING out there.  Try them out at 
                        CDROM.COM on the internet!) Also I want to thank 
                        the loan company who I owe......BIG!!!! I have 
                        beaten the level on all difficulty levels, but for
                        some strange reason, I can never get 100% kills on
                        either 4 or 5.  (Hmmm CyberDemon maybe??) Anyway,
                        it IS possible. (Really! I mean it!!)
