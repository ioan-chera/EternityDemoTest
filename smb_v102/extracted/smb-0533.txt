SKYMAYBE.WAD + BLESSED.DEH e2m1 skill 4 speedrun in 5:33

(Note that the menu for this wad refers to skill 1 as "Ultra Violence",
while skill 4 is labeled as "No Chance", so I'm referring to this as a
"skill 4" speedrun to avoid ambiguity.)

Recorded on Chocolate-doom.exe version 1.1.1 with -longtics

Play Instructions:

*Obtaining the necessary files*

First, download smb_v102.zip from
http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=8079.
Run SKYMAYBE.EXE, which is a self-extracting RAR archive. Set a destination
directory and then run the extraction. The files of note that will be
extracted are _SMB147.WAD, BLESSED.DEH, and INSTALL.EXE.
You can use _SMB147.WAD and BLESSED.DEH to run this demo, but because
of some missing markers in the wad, most replacement sprites will not
appear, even if you use Chocolate-Doom's -merge command. To get the proper
SKY MAY BE experience, you need to go one step further. Run INSTALL.EXE.
Give it the directory of a vanilla Doom 1 install. This will create a
patched exe in your Doom folder, and more importantly, the directory
from which you ran INSTALL.EXE will now contain SKYMAYBE.WAD.

*Playing the demo*

I have tested four options and found that they all work without desynch

1. Chocolate-doom -iwad doom.wad -file skymaybe.wad -deh blessed.deh -playdemo smb-0533.lmp
2. Prboom-plus -iwad doom -file skymaybe -deh blessed -playdemo smb-0533

And if you're willing to have some incorrect sprites:

3. Chocolate-doom -iwad doom.wad -merge _smb417.wad -deh blessed.deh -playdemo smb-0533.lmp
4. prboom-plus -iwad doom -file _smb417 -deh blessed -playdemo smb-0533

Play-by-play:

0:10 - Yeah, the demo starts slow. Sorry about that. You can tell I've waited
for that lift a few too many times, killed those three imps a few too many times...

0:45 - This wad is riddled with major challenges that aren't obvious or
necessarily even visible in a recorded run of it. This right here is the
prime example. It looks like I'm just running around a cluster of docile imps
and killing one interloper before continuing on my way. What you miss is that
I'm navigating a 32-unit wide strip between the right edge of the platform and 
three invisible walls. You also don't realize that the imps usually aren't so
fortuitously clustered towards the left. It's quite random where they'll be
each time you reach the top of that platform, and I'm this lucky about 1 in 20
attempts. But now you say, bah, imps. Just shoot them out of your path. Sadly,
the same invisible walls that limit my movement also block my fire. And
need I remind you that the imps are armed with BFGs? When you get past them,
you'll probably still be fried from behind by stray tracers. Anyways, it's
good to get the hardest part of the run over with. [/rant]

1:15 - This is another interesting little area. The walls of this hallway are
actually double-sided mid-textured lines, which are impassable for you, but not
for the BFG bolts of the six imps that guard it. Because I need to go through
here three times over the course of the run, once without the aid of wallrunning,
it's important to dilute the threat a tad. However, to follow one of my constantly-
splash-damaging rockets down the hall would be too slow, so instead I offer one
to the imps as a parting gift.

Also, speaking of wallrunning, I found it to be strangely useless almost everywhere
else in this level. This is one of only two places where I could reliably make it
occur.

1:25 - Ah, the biggest mistake in the run. It's actually possible to get underneath
that door before it closes again, if you maneuver through here perfectly. I didn't.

1:45 - More little delays. That demon has a 50% chance of blocking your path, and
the coin came up the wrong way. I also lose several seconds due to a short fall
from the tower - even with invulnerability, those SSG-guys are a lot of trouble.
I wish there weren't these avoidable errors in this run, but it took a lot of
attempts to even do this well, as almost all of them fail at around 0:45...

2:10 - Even though this is a Doom 1 project, it uses some Doom 2 line actions
and codepointers. If you pay attention, you'll notice a demon being resurrected
by a flaming barrel.

3:00 - I have to use my automap to get through here, in case you're curious.

3:15 - Something I only noticed when playing this demo back is that the 
sargeant who teleports in releases the imps with his gunfire. I'm very lucky to have
left alive.

3:50 - Yeah, the demo ends slow. Sorry about that. I did my best to do something
interesting with the time it takes for the lift to lower - namely, I demonstrated
that it is in fact possible to run halfway across the map, grab an unnecessary
soul sphere, and return before the lift is even all the way down. I also could
have grabbed the chainsaw from the secret door in the pillar at the level start.
Or I could have forgone both of those ideas and just spent some time reading
the scrolling rules. They're amusing.

4:45 - It crossed my mind that, with this project's peculiar splash damage-based
weaponry, it might be possible to rocket-jump across these gaps, and thus reach
the yellow key without raising the platform. I couldn't get it to work, though,
and it's a moot point anyway. One of the lines that border the platform is a
trigger that has to be crossed before you can finish the level.

5:05 - This door is brutal. It ruined most of the runs that got this far
(including a couple that were better than this one). You open the door by
crossing an arbitrary, indistinguishable line about two thirds of the way
up the second staircase, and then you have to bounce back down to it and
slide into it before it closes - an act that is easy to screw up under pressure.

============================================
Other thoughts:

Since there's room for improvement here, I may work at recording a better demo
if this stirs up any interest. I'm also tempted to work on a MAX demo, as the
peculiarties of the Blessed engine would make it very interesting to watch.
Such a demo would feature many areas that can be skipped in a speedrun. Also,
I suspect that the fastest way to clear some areas of their monsters would
be to grab the mine layer weapon (plasma gun replacement) and just plant some
mines while the player busies himself somewhere else. Now, these mines are also
a major threat to the player, and last a considerable amount of time,
so the tactical decisions involved (where do I plant mines and when?) would be 
of a sort wholly new to Doom speedruns, as far as I know. Let's see if I get
back to this.
