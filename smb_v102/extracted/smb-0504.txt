SKYMAYBE.WAD + BLESSED.DEH e2m1 skill 4 speedrun in 5:04

(Note that the menu for this wad refers to skill 1 as "Ultra Violence",
while skill 4 is labeled as "No Chance", so I'm referring to this as a
"skill 4" speedrun to avoid ambiguity.)

==============================================
Play Instructions:

*Obtaining the necessary files*

First, download smb_v102.zip from <http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=8079>.
Run SKYMAYBE.EXE, which is a self-extracting RAR archive. Set a destination
directory and then run the extraction. The files of note that will be extracted
are _SMB147.WAD, BLESSED.DEH, and INSTALL.EXE. You can use _SMB147.WAD and
BLESSED.DEH to run this demo, but because of some missing markers in the wad,
most replacement sprites will not appear. To get the proper SKY MAY BE experience,
you need to go one step further. Run INSTALL.EXE. Give it the directory of a
vanilla Doom 1 install. This will create a patched exe in your Doom folder,
and more importantly, the directory from which you ran INSTALL.EXE will now
contain SKYMAYBE.WAD.

*Playing the demo*

Recommended options:

1. Chocolate-doom -iwad doom.wad -file skymaybe.wad -deh blessed.deh -playdemo smb-0504.lmp
2. Prboom-plus -iwad doom -file skymaybe -deh blessed -playdemo smb-0504

And if you're willing to have some incorrect sprites:

3. Chocolate-doom -iwad doom.wad -merge _smb417.wad -deh blessed.deh -playdemo smb-0504.lmp
4. prboom-plus -iwad doom -file _smb417 -deh blessed -playdemo smb-0504

"-gameversion 1.9" is not necessary to include in the playback command line for Chocolate
Doom. It makes lost souls and radioactive mines appear to move slightly differently but
I've never observed a demo desynch because of this.

============================================
By my estimates, a non-TAS run could still be 10-15 seconds faster, and a perfect
built run that exploited every possible helpful monster action could be considerably
faster than that, yet. But it's time for me to wrap up my efforts and move on. Despite still
being a bit sub-par, this demo is worth watching for a couple clever new shortcuts it
exhibits. Watch carefully, or you might miss 'em.

Play-by-play:

0:00 - Is it possible to start moving before the screen wipe finishes? I never manage.

0:25 - I should have alerted the shotgun guys later, and from further south, which
would have promoted better clustering. I'm not sure why I didn't in this run.

0:45 - This period, from reaching the top of the platform with the imps and invisible
walls to when I reach the crushers at around 0:55, is optimal, despite the 2 second pause.
If you reach the crushers sooner then you just have to wait longer for them to open up.

1:20 - I don't quite squeeze under the door before it closes, which is a shame. This is
no great time loss but it looks pretty impressive when I pull it off.

1:30 - This section goes pretty well. I think that leaving the invulnerability sphere
behind actually makes me more effective against the shotgun guys. Vulnerability keeps
me on my toes.

1:50 - Exploiting auto-aim to hit a shootable switch early? I bet you've never seen
that in a demo before. Hitting that switch and quickly grabbing the blue key
afterwards takes a LOT of luck. The monsters almost always fail to cooperate.

2:20 - It's hard to see exactly how fast I'm moving after that rocket boost, as there's
little visual context. But trust me - it's fast. This move saves about five seconds.
In fact, if I perform this boost trick from the southeast corner of the high platform,
I can land on the thin ledge that surrounds the building I land in front of. Now THAT
is a rocket jump.

2:25 - The good luck I had in the room with the sergeants is here paid back - and then
some. Of course, firing that rocket was a bad move and only I am to blame for it. Even
though I'm invincible, it's pushing out damage too fast for me to be able to approach
it.

2:35 - Invincibility has the reciprocal benefit of fudging with the COLORMAP, which
makes it easier to judge where the hidden door is supposed to be.

2:45 - I miss my bus here. Ideally I would move through this section fast enough to
be able to pass through a different opening in the crushers before it closes, which
would save... well, just a second. But again, it's more impressive when I pull it
off.

3:00 - I get delayed by all three of these former humans! All three! The negative
movement speed of these guys makes them completely unpredictable. Sometimes they
help, but opening a door at a surprisingly convenient time, but this time they all
manage to be hindrances. This is hideously bad luck.

3:30 - Glancing at the rules here gives me a bit of feedback on how I'm doing for
time. It looks like we're not too far into Rule 4 here, which is good (but it could
be better).

4:20 - I alert the zombies early to cause them to cluster. I think it's easier to
deal with them if they're grouped.

4:35 - This rocket-fueled turnaround seems like the best use of some extra health.
Saves a couple seconds.

5:00 - Wonderful - here I get snagged on a zombie one final time. I wish there was
a tactic that could be used to consistently avoid this one but there's nothing you
can do to guarantee a quick passage.

5:25 - As per tradition I screw around in e2m2 for a bit. Enjoy.
