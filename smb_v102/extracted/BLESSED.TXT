NOTE
====

This documentation relates to the modified version of Blessed 1.6B used
in the DOOM mega epic The Sky May Be.
Watch out for the full release of Blessed 1.9.. out now!


What is Blessed??
=================

Personally, I find doom boring.  To cure this, I created The BLESSED Engine.

	BLESSED - Ever wondered what E=MCý FEELS like?!?
	Now you too can experience the agony of mass-energy conversion!


BLESSED ENGINE DOCUMENTATION
----------------------------

Title                   : The Blessed Engine 1.6b
Author                  : DOUG the Eagle and KANSAM
Author Email            : b52g@usa.net
Misc. Author Info       : KANSAM for the main DeHackIng
			  DOUG for ideas, moral support, music, other hacking
			  DOUG is an F15i Eagle.  He works for the USAF, and
			  also spends most of his spare computing cycles as a
			  quake server. He can thrash anybody at most games.

Description             : Doom, but much, MUCH harder. Most of the weapons and 
			  monsters have been radically overhauled, and are
			  described hereunder.

Monsters:
=========

	TROOPER         : Runs away from you. Metamorphoses into an evil bugger 
			  when he dies!

	SERGEANT        : Armed with Super-shotgun

	IMPS            : The imps are armed with the BFG.

	DEMONS          : Armed with a VERY NASTY missile weapon which fires
                          harmless plasma bolts; however, the plasma attacks
                          you with chaingun fire...
			  Explodes into incandescent energy on death.

	SPECTRES        : Slaps you when it's alive, slays you when it dies.
                          Note that the spectres are now VISIBLE.

	LOST SOULS      : Don't let them touch you..

	CACODEMONS      : Edward Diego. Purifies you if you get close, and has a
			  nasty habit when he dies

	BARON OF HELL   : Normal, but the pink shit he throws at you will slay
			  you dead, even in God mode.

	CYBERDEMON      : More or less normal.

	SPIDERDEMON     : Flies.

	Oh, and watch out for the barrels.


Weapons:
========

        THE FIST        : Meet Mr. Fist.  He's not a very nice person. 

	PLASMA CUTTER   : Cuts through most substances.

	PISTOL          : Flameless. Fires around 500 bullets per minute with
			  pixel accuracy.

	SHOTGUN         : You know the RF Skorpion from System Shock? What you
		          have here is a recoilless high-speed murder weapon.
			  Fires about 1600 bullets/min

	CHAINGUN        : Instant Discharge Cannon. Fires up to 400 bullets 
			  simultaneously.

	ROCKET LAUNCHER : Very dangerous, to you and everyone else. You MUST be
			  moving (preferably running) backwards when you fire.

	PLASMA GUN      : The Mine Launcher. 
			  The shot emerges as a green-and-yellow ball. It will
			  hit the ground, and sit there looking dopey. HOWEVER:
			  in a few seconds it will split into three yellow-and-
			  red spheres. These are BLOODY DANGEROUS. If you go 
			  near these, you will have to be carried home in a 
			  bucket. The trio of spheres will remain for about 20
			  seconds, unless interfered with. It is possible to 
			  blow them up, which gets rid of them quicker. If at 
			  any point there is only one left, it will remain
			  for about a minute, or until someone shoots it. 
			  You have been warned.

	BLESSING CANNON : The eponymous weapon. If a shot from this holy device
			  hits an enemy, it will either expel them as gamma rays
			  or leave them immortal. Apply with EXTREME caution.

ADDITIONAL
==========

		The messages in the game have been altered by some diabolical
		influence (Kansam, actually), providing handy new directions
		to aid your quest.

		The Great God Imp has been added, replacing the Pole-With-Skull
		decoration.  The Cyberdemon has been twickled a bit and is
		slightly buggy.  Poor chap often gets fried by his own rockets.

		Please do NOT use this engine outside of SKYMAYBE.
		The full version of Blessed 1.9 ought to be available from the
		same place you got this.
