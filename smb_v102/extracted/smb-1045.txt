SKYMAYBE.WAD + BLESSED.DEH e2m1 skill 4 MAX run in 10:45

(Note that the menu for this wad refers to skill 1 as "Ultra Violence",
while skill 4 is labeled as "No Chance", so I'm referring to this as a
"skill 4" speedrun to avoid ambiguity.)

Recorded with Prboom-plus -complevel 2 -longtics
Prboom+ version: 2.5.0.3

Kills: 99%
Items: 80%
Secrets: 66%
(An explanation of these numbers is below.)

==============================================
Notes on final percentages:

All killable monsters that affect kill percentage are disposed of in this demo.
A true 100% kills run of this level is impossible, because, as far as I was
able to figure out, the Great God Imp affects kill percentage, while being
entirely indestructable. Telefragging, splash damage, hitscan attacks and
the Blessing Cannon (which deals damage in the billions) leave him unfazed.
100% kills is still possible, but only if a flaming barrel is allowed to
resurrect another monster (yes, this is possible). That does not occur in this
demo.

For the record:
-Lost souls, as always, don't affect kill%.
-Regular barrels, though they are now autonomous, don't affect kill%.
-The second form of former humans (which I think is a modified clip) doesn't
affect kill%, so I ignore it when possible.
-Trees, though they are now destructable, don't affect kill%.
-Flaming barrels, however, DO affect kill% directly, and also indirectly
(via their resurrection ability) so these are all destroyed.

100% secrets is impossible because two of six secret sectors cannot be reached
by normal means: sectors 151 and 588. Sector 588 could possibly be reached if
the player could manage to cross a teleport line without triggering it, but
nothing of this sort was attempted, because secret sectors that require this
sort of effort to reach have traditionally been exempt from MAX runs.

100% items is possible but is a waste of time.

==============================================
Play Instructions:

*Obtaining the necessary files*

First, download smb_v102.zip from <http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=8079>.
Run SKYMAYBE.EXE, which is a self-extracting RAR archive. Set a destination
directory and then run the extraction. The files of note that will be extracted
are _SMB147.WAD, BLESSED.DEH, and INSTALL.EXE. You can use _SMB147.WAD and
BLESSED.DEH to run this demo, but because of some missing markers in the wad,
most replacement sprites will not appear. To get the proper SKY MAY BE experience,
you need to go one step further. Run INSTALL.EXE. Give it the directory of a
vanilla Doom 1 install. This will create a patched exe in your Doom folder,
and more importantly, the directory from which you ran INSTALL.EXE will now
contain SKYMAYBE.WAD.

*Playing the demo*

You have fewer options this time around. The Great God Imp's huge alert sound 
seems to mess things up in memory for Chocolate Doom. On most attempted runs, Chocolate-
doom.exe will crash outright when he is met, which is why I chose to record in Prboom+
instead. This demo doesn't cause Chocolate-Doom to crash, but his alert sound still
may cause some glitches which are then exascerbated by use of the Blessing Cannon later
on which apparently causes a desynch at the end of the demo... anyways, it's complicated.
Use Prboom+ to play this demo.

Your options (-complevel 2 can probably be omitted):
1. Prboom-plus -iwad doom -file skymaybe -deh blessed -playdemo smb-1045 -complevel 2
Or, if you don't mind incorrect sprites:
2. Prboom-plus -iwad doom -file _smb417 -deh blessed -playdemo smb-1045 -complevel 2

If you're REALLY determined to play this demo with Chocolate-doom, I have been able
to play this demo on it without desynch after hand-editing a copy of SKYMAYBE.WAD
to replace the Great God Imp's alert sound with a smaller sound clip.

============================================
Playing notes:

Though I recorded this on Prboom+, I tried to avoid using that port's advantages;
I never used freelook or advanced HUD information. I will admit, however, that the
higher screen resolution was helpful in this large map.

Yes, this run is legit :) If it ever looks too polished, that's what happens when
you're forced to run the same sequences of actions over and over and over and over...

To facilitate use of SR50 I used my G5's driver software to bind ALT+Left to one
of my extra mouse buttons and ALT+Right to another. I think that's fair.

I recorded this with a modified copy of blessed.deh. The only changes made were
to the cheat code strings, which were causing input glitches in their original form.
Gameplay was entirely unaffected by this change, obviously, as the demo plays back
correctly with blessed.deh.

============================================
Play-by-play:

I'm writing some notes in here to help you better understand this project's
quirks and challenges, and also because I like to write. There are additional
notes in the textfile of my earlier non-max speedrun. But, if you really want to know
what's going on, then I have to recommend loading this project up and trying it out
yourself. It's kind of like the Matrix. No one can be told what The Sky May Be is.

0:50 - I've gotten a bit better at getting past these extremely deadly imps and
their invisible walls, thanks to all this practice I've been forced to get. Also,
as this is a MAX run and not a pure speedrun I've been more willing to wait some
seconds for more opportune imp clustering. These two factors together have brought my
rate of survival for this portion of the level all the way up to about 20%. That would
be 0% if not for the blessedly limited distance that BFG tracers can travel.

1:30 - I'd rather take care of these zombiemen later, when I have the ammo to quickly
kill their kill-percentage affecting primary forms and their highly-threatening
secondaries, all at once. However, because former humans have their speed set in the
negatives, they run away from you - and this makes their future locations extremely
hard to predict. Sometimes when I come back later they'll be waiting right here, and
sometimes they'll be running along the north and west edges of the level, which
obviously won't do.

1:40 - I'm not positive that I can justify grabbing this "instant discharge cannon"
in terms of an amount of time it saves me. However, I can definitely say that it
increases the odds of my survival, later on, at a moment when I need every advantage
I can get. That is justification enough.

Also, I wanted this demo to showcase all of The Sky May Be's quirkier weapons :)

2:45 - This is definitely the fastest I have ever cleared the monsters out of this
room - faster than any other recorded attempts or practice runs. I was pretty pumped
about that.

3:00 - I drop a couple mines just in case I've missed a cacodemon or two, so they
can wander into these mines and die while I'm already busying myself elsewhere.
I use variations of this tactic several more times throughout the demo. I strongly
recommend watching this demo a second time with the automap on, and IDDT*2, to see
how well it can work. This time, however, all of the cacodemons have already been
eliminated, so the mines are an unused safety precaution.


3:35 - I suffer a minor delay here, when I fire my radiation rockets too close to
the monsters for them to be effective and decide to punch my way through my
opposition instead. I'm not that great at thinking on my feet, so I only realized
during demo playback that I missed an opportunity here. As the former humans'
second form is a modified clip (I think), it is instantly destroyed by crushing
ceilings, or even by the innocuous closing of any door. I could have used this
doorway to instantly crush both "clips" to death, saving a second or two while
demonstrating another of this wad's oddities.

4:40 - Punching this soul sphere actually serves a purpose. I'm alerting a
cacodemon that you're about to meet.

5:30 - Like with the chaingun, I can't be sure that grabbing this berserk pack saves
time. But, I can say that there's a good possibility it'll save my ass.

5:35 - For some reason, the cyberdemon's immunity to splash damage was removed during
DeHackEd editing. No complaints here. Bombs away!

6:05 - The trick to survival in this place is to just keep moving. Don't stop, don't
backtrack, just keep pushing forward, press switches, and stir up some infighting.
You may notice that I did do some slight backtracking to punch a baron. I'm lucky
to have survived, judging by all the bfg shots that glanced off the ledges above me.

6:25 - I love this fort. Even if it wasn't one of the level's official secrets,
I would still come in here. It's just such a clever little contraption!

6:55 - There may seem to be some redundancy in this route, but I think my technique
here is reasonably efficient - take one trip around this room to press buttons and
promote infighting, and another trip while exiting to lay some safety mines.
However, as I find and punch to death all three monsters I meant for the mines to
trap, this is another case where some minelaying could have been skipped.

7:40 - This little aside, where I climb a set of stairs merely to kill 2 imps
before climbing back down, is intentional and planned. In these tunnels, sound
cues are extremely important, and I need to be able to hear the rumbling of any
additional imps and the giggling of any former humans that may still be lurking
in the vicinity. (The slobbering of the former humans' second form can be
safely ignored). However, I am luckily gifted with pure silence.

8:20 - Strategically, these mines offer myriads of possibilities. The quirk I
exploit here is the fact that monsters will choose the mines themselves as their
targets when injured by them. This isn't often noticed during typical gameplay,
however, because everything that wanders into a fresh minefied dies before
it can target anything. Essentially the only time this effect can be noticed is
when a rocket-firing demon gets killed by a mine, at which point, the demon's
rocket will USUALLY aim at the mine itself. For all other cases, you have to be
careful.

Another strategic possibility presented by mines, not even used in this demo, is
that they absorb hitscan attacks. I briefly considered attempting to build
makeshift fortifications of this sort to help deal with the spiderdemons but
decided against it.

8:50 - Every time I watch a recording of this section of the level I discover that
I was about two inches away from death at one point and never knew it. I barely
teleport out before a rocket hits me - and those rockets do a lot more damage than
usual.

9:15 - Two glitches make a right. The problem is that this level, and especially
this room, is littered with lines that autoaim refuses to cross. Even when the
mastermind is much closer, there's a good chance that my attacks will just fly
underneath its legs while it mocks me. So how do I deal with that? Take advantage
of another glitch - the newly flying spider mastermind doesn't quite have his air
legs yet and doesn't feel comfortable flying all the way down to the ground - 
which means that he remains higher up, and as long as I'm pressed up against his
bounding box, his fire goes clear over my head. In this position I can then
hit him right where it hurts with my hard-earned Blessing Cannon.

10:25 - I made it! Or have I? At this point, I am literally shaking with
excitement; I can't believe that every section of the level has gone so well, so
naturally, I almost screw up and die. I'm very fortunate that I only got clipped
by the Great God Imp's BFG blast, as I stumbled past him rather incautiously. I'm
also sort of glad that I ran into the GGI again, though. His final appearance
really completes the demo, I think. He is what makes the end of this level epic.
Almost getting murdered by former humans at the extreme end of the demo is not
nearly so epic... just a sloppy brush with disaster.
