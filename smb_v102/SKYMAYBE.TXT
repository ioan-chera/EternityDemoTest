I advise you to read this, and blessed.txt in particular.
Blessed.txt will explain the differences between SkyMayBe and Doom.
Hints (if you get stuck) are near the end of the file.


Title                   : The Sky May Be
Filename                : Skymaybe.exe ,skymaybe.r00, skymaybe.r01...
Author                  : DOUG the EAGLE and KANSAM  (see kansam's trial 4!!)
Email Address           : b52g@usa.net, boff@globalnet.co.uk

Misc. Author Info       : There's a portrait of DOUG in a secret room. Find it!

Description             : Requires Doom 1.6 or above.

                          This is the STRANGEST wad ever made.
                          Most of the action takes place in a cube
                          8192x8192x8192 in size..
                          A two-year production with more new graphics
                          than any other PWAD in the known galaxy.
                          Built using monomolecular technology in DEU!
                          (Grid size 4:1 is still too small [sigh])

Plot                    : Wyth this gunpowder shall we slaye the King...

Story                   : The Great God Imp has shown mercy on your soul and
			  cast you into the hellish pits of his virtual toybox.

			  Running around the garish lego buildings, you become
			  aware that the virtual toychest is actually running
			  under windows 3.11.  However the mouse is broken
			  and the ALT and F4 keys have been removed.

			  You must find a way to shut down the system and end
			  this nightmare!

                          Oh, and watch out for the Great God Imp.
                          He may not be so kind next time He sees you.

                          and Windows 3.11.  I have a win95-proof PC.

Known Bugs              : This WAD reaches the limits of DOOM.  I had to hand
                          optimise it to get it to run without crashing.

                          There is no known HOM and you can save the game.

                          There are now THREE bugs.
                          1.  The Cyberdemon seems to die easily, it gets burnt
                              by its own rockets.
                          2.  The level is now officially Too Big, and DOS may
                              crash when you quit the program.
                          2.  I forgot to put rule 6 in. :-)

Miscellany              : BSP/OS2 was accidentally created when I recompiled
                          BSP 1.2 with the wrong dos extender.  EagleBSP was
                          a DPMI/16 nodebuilder.  Didn't work any better tho'.

                          The three new musics are:
                          e1m1: stolen from DGOLDBT.
                          e1m2: Prokofiev's Dance of the Knights.
                          e2m1: Bach's Brandenburg concerto number three.
                                Slightly modified to make it sound under
                                wavetable, more like it does under adlib.
                                I have an all-electric version on my hard disk!

                          I like classical music with Doom.  Try to imagine
                          what Bach would think if he knew about this!!

                          Much of this level was inspired by my favourites..
                          Cleimos v2, The Apocalypse, Mountain, MUD, and all
                          those other complete episodes out there..

                          I have discovered the secret of how to construct a
                          future-proof PC.  Windows 95 is obviously the future.
                          A certain combination of expansion cards and you have
                          a system conflict that is harmless to DOS, but
                          destroys the Windows 95 PnP manager totally.

                          When the blockmap was >64k, Doom went all funny
                          and started overwriting bits of memory at random.
                          Graphics, sounds and finally code were eaten as the
                          game progressed.  Segmentation lives!!

                          Another way to total windows 95 is to play Bach's
                          Brandenburg Concerto number three with media player.
                          It doesn't crash all the time, but you'd better have
                          the disks ready when it does!
                          It's the only way I know of to get a GPF in MSGSVR32.

                          Caldera OpenDOS is a free DOS operating system
                          brought to you by Digital Research, Novell and
                          Caldera.  It is free for non-commercial use.

                          The name The Sky May Be was chosen because I was
                          experimenting with Olivier Montanuy's DEUTEX and
                          playing with the sky. I was trying to create a sky
                          720ø round, with the words "REPENT, SINNER!" written
                          in blood so it only appeared if you did two complete
                          turns.  I wasn't sure if it would work (it didn't) 
                          so it was called skymaybe 'sky (maybe)' and the name
                          stuck.

Revision History
================

V1.00 - Initial release.
V1.01 - Fixes a bug in DeuSF that removed my NULL sound entries and crashed
        the game when a cacodemon Purifies you.
V1.02 - Replaced the two Beavis+Butthead samples from DSW, the sound component.
        Same words, but by me (highly processed).
        Never knew I had such an evil-sounding voice.
	Added more Things to the level.. Murder in the Dark is wicked now!

HINTS
=====

1.  Remember to press the OK buttons when you find them!

2.  Run backwards when firing the mine or rocket launchers to avoid 75% burns.

3.  Trees CAN be destroyed.

4.  The Blessing Cannon (BFG) is accessable via the red teleport column in
    Murder In The Dark.  You need to do some work before you get it though!

5.  There is a secret panel in the Steel Cube (beyond the trees).
    It looks different to the rest of the wall and allows you to get the
    Mine Launcher.

6.  There is a teleport to an ammo dump in Castle Crate.

7.  To get to the yellow key, find the red post and press the button on it.
    Run!!

8.  For a laugh in the final room, save the game, press CANCEL and *RUN!*
