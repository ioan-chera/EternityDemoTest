If you've seen my 9:10 max demo for this level, you may recall a series of trick
jumps I used to clear out the entire exit room long before you're supposed to be
there.  Here, I use a few of them as part of my demonstration of how you can
beat this level in less than two and a half minutes despite the 600 or so
monsters.

Note that the first jump down from where you get the yellow key is severely
luck-based; either you'll make it down, or you'll be blocked by the dozens of
monsters standing beneath you.  Most often, it's the latter.
