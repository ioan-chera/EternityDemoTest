              PLEASE READ THIS TEXT! IMPORTANT INFO. ENCLOSED!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
COPYRIGHT NOTICE: You may edit, alter, or modify any material with in the
                  level you downloaded. If you decide to upload your
                  changes to a BBS, or software library, Please include
                  the author of the original level (George Fiffy, a.k.a.
                  Resident Expert of Leominster) in your credits! 
                  FEEL FREE TO DISTRIBUTE THIS DOOM LEVEL!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------                 
A MENU SYSTEM IS ENCLOSED! This menu, which is shareware (it says so), is
  something I copied off the college computers. Instead of typing in the
  loooooong DOOM command line to get to this level, you just select the
  level of difficulty from the menu. You can escape to DOS, and there's
  an option to load a game, using the simple DOOM command line. You will
  recieve the following files:

                REoLDOOM.COM, AUTOMENU.MDF, and ECHO.DAT.

     These are IMPORTANT files! Do NOT remove them unless you don't want
  the menu system. You can make your own menu by using a text editor to
  modify the AUTOMENU.MDF file. It's easy to see how it works! A new file
  will be created the first time you run the menu. DON'T PANIC! It does
  this so you can escape to DOS a lot faster the next time around, and in
  the future. ALL IS TESTED TO BE 100% VIRUS-FREE!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT THE TOTAL WAR III EXPERIENCE:
     To play the new level, type REoLDOOM to start total chaos!
     This is probably one of the weirdest DOOM levels you may ever had
  played! There are soooo many weird effects and illusions you may have
  thought would be IMPOSSIBLE to do (if you're a DOOM level maker your-
  self)! The effects you will see start right in the beginning! A door
  in the middle of the starting area! You'll also see doors coming out
  of the sky, dark rooms you can see fine in (it doesn't make sense at
  all, doesn't it? Well, it was done. You'll be suprised!), and get this,
  INVISABLE BUILDINGS! You may see the doors (sometimes), and maybe the
  windows, but you don't see a building attatched! The "pancake syndrome"
  is also cleared up (flat outer retaining walls, and unflattened entry-
  ways can be seen BEYOND the walls, to show thickness, unlike E3M1).
  Some "flatness" is around, but that's because there are invisable
  buildings around. Invisable doors leave "slices" or voids in the wall,
  or the top of the wall.
      One neat DOOM effect is the Hall Of Mirrors. One room has this
  effect in it's windows. This is NO screw-up. It's done on PURPOSE!
      The "teleporting theory" found in the real E3M7 is also in here,
  but with a different twist. All I'm going to say is that it's harder to
  do (heh, heh, heh!).
      Also, be carefull of a few nasty areas! There are five areas where
  you'll be fighting very hard! You won't be fighting as hard as in TOTAL
  WAR II, E1M2, but it's quite a nasty brawl!

  MULTI-PLAYER: This is an adventure for up to four of your friends. Each
     can grab a shotgun and a backpack at the start, so don't be greedy!

  DEATHMATCH: You'll start off with a shotgun, shells, and an energy
     pack next to you. Why the energy pack? SOMEWHERE (not in a secret
     area) in this world is a BFG9000! Two of you will be very close!
     The other two people are also in good position to get it as well!

  KNOWN "BOO-BOOS":
  * Once again, I ran into that "there's too many enemies on-screen"
    problem again. Some enemies or other things may "dissapear". Oh well,
    if it happened in E1M2 of TOTAL WAR II, it'll happen here (ha,ha!)!
  * There is a Hall Of Mirrors problem at the "Triangular switchboard".
    It's only a small band. This is NOT suposed to happen! No big deal!
  * A switch that suposed to open an invisable door and keep it open is
    somehow shut on occasion by the enemies you face. I fixed this by
    making it's switch retriggerable, in case it happens again.
  * Got a PENTIUM? If not, it's alright, if you have a high speed 486
    at 33MHz or greater (my 486 is a 20. Goes real slow on this one!).
    If you have a (lowly) 386, I hope it's going 50 to 66MHz!
  * Demo is known to CRASH on my crash-happy computer. If this does
    happen to you, please shut off your EMM836 memory manager. It
    ALWAYS worked when it was turned off.

                (Optional. I like to hear from you though.)
  QUESTIONAIRE: Cut out this section of text on DOS's EDIT, or any
     word processor. Type in answers BELOW the questions, and send the
     QUESTIONAIRE part to the above E-mail addresses. I recomend pasting
     this into your writing space when answering your mail instead of 
     sending it as a file. 

(1) What do you like about REoL TOUGH: TOTAL WAR III, Land of Weirdness?

(2) How do you like the difficulty of this level?

(3) How do you rate the construction of this level? Make any comments,
    if you have any:

(4) If any, what improvements would you want to see in the upcoming
    REoL TOUGH levels?

(5) If any, other comments:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Some people wonder why I don't make an entire episode. As you can see,
construction is pretty complex, quite large, and does look like it takes
FOREVER (two weeks, before college beginns in September), and it DOES! I
have no time to make episodes! I just make very big levels.
