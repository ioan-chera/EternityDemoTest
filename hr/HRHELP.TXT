Hell Revealed help demos
------------------------
These are 32 -nomonsters demos showing how to finish all levels of Hell Revealed
with 100% secrets. Level 7 is impossible to finish with -nomonsters, so I
recorded it on skill 1. I tried to do the demos as fast as possible.

To play back the demos type:

doom2 -file hr.wad -playdemo hr??-nom

Replace ?? with the two-digit level number.

These demos are for people who are stuck in a particular level, or can't get
100% secrets in a level, and don't have the patience to watch the all
kills/secrets UV demo. I hope they will be helpful.
