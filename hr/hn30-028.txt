  Description :-)
  
  Well... this level is very hard on NightMare
  skill... but once you learn it there is some
  stuff which gets better by practice... One mistake
  and you're dead though.
  
  As Yonatan said, key here is speed... and that
  applies to NM skill too (tried more "safer" ways
  but they didn't really work).

  Had two 0:29's before but didn't like them :)
