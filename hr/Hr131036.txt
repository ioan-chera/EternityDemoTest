  Lots of fun to be had here. Plenty of cyber infighting and archies grouped
  with other enemies. Rockets and cells come in very limited amounts, so you
  need to get the cybers to do most of the work for you. Like in hr14, if 
  the infighting gets going nice and heavy and the archies all fall quickly 
  even a low 9:xx should be possible.
