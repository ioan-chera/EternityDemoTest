Description:  Heh, just playing this for fun. I got a 33:16 with no
              backpack (and lots of ammo difficulties) and it seemed like
              I could beat Yonatan's time in hruvlmp2, so I did. I'm not
              sure if this demo has good tactics or not - I waste rockets
              on the first bunch of revenants, and waste plasma in the spider
              room. Then a bridge failed to rise for some reason and Archie
              decided to resurrect a Baron. So I lost a few minutes at the
              end. It's a pity your ammo always runs out - there's about
              ten Barons too many...
