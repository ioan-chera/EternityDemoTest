  Description:  I had a 4:11 I got a few months back, but I wanted a time
                below four minutes. This didn't take too long to get.
                It looks a lot less impressive than the 4:11, but
                maybe the route is a bit more familiar and some
                parts you don't notice went well. Anyway I'm sure a time
                below 3min will eventually be possible.
