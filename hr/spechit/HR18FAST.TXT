Description:

This one really wasn't that hard, well at least not after doing map 26. :-)
Still, I'm surprised nobody's done it already.  There's loads of ammo and
health and most of the monsters just line up for you to shoot 'em down.
As expected, critical parts were shooting those one million revenants through
a tiny window (gotta watch IDDT for incomings!) and the dark/teleporter room.
The cybie-telefrag chase was no problem, once I figured out a safe way to
do it...

Special thanks to all the other HR-fast players for inspiration. :-)
