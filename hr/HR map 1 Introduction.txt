This is the first map of Hell Revealed. Hell Revealed is a hard megawad but very famous, it have the skill same
as Alien Vendetta or something, I don't know.

This map is extremly easy, only hard(Really?) area is the last area of that teleporter. I have thought that the
chaingunner may come out and kill those shotgun guys for me at the start, but no.

I just kill the demons with fist in that tech-base room, everything is easy. Nothing to say now!
