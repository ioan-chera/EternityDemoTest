Description -
Well, at first I had a 11:09 maxdemo that I recorded with the Complevel 2 parameter set,
but when I went back to watch it (after already mailing it to Opulent) I realized that the
damn thing didn't work right.... Went out of sync right as the demo started.... Ohhh, but I
was really, really pissed off... So I went and looked at the demo text files that came with
the newest version of Prboom, and it seems that the Complevel 0 is the one that is used for
doom and Doom 2 version 1.9.... Well, that would explain the weird things that happened in 
the making of the other demo (archviles and chaingunners being stuck together and such)...
That doesnt happen here... :) Okay, now I'm done with this map.... I love it to death, but
am now sick of recording it.... Thanks for beating my times here Eugene, without your kick
ass demos, this route would have remained hidden for a long ass time.... Oh and Doug, again
thanks for the tips with the other demos I sent... They did pay off, by over a minute... :)

Laters all,
