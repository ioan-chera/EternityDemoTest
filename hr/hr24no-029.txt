Well, I looked at my other nomo run in 0:37, and it was very stupid of me to
grab the invuln because there's tons of megaspheres around... and it's nomon-
sters, for goodness sakes! Well, I figured I could get this under 0:30. I have
included a bonus run in 0:30.34 that I got before the 0:29.74 run. Took two
tries to get the 0:30, three more to get the 0:29. :)
