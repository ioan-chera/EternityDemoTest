Description

Well , where to start.... First off I sent Yonatan a demo of this level before , the time was 23 something , so heres a faster one (no record , but it's well under the 30:00 mark). The .txt file didn't work for that one so instead of making a new .txt file I re-recorded the level.

Post Mortem is in my opinion the best HR level , it's the funniest to play and I love how it is set up. Although many people think it is the hardest HR map of the game , I'd have to agree with both Yonatan and Peo that Afterlife is harder then it. I've beat Post Mortem on many occasions , while I've only past Afterlife on UV without saves 3 times. Now I only play with savegames (its funner that way).

The demo included isn't the best time I've got I once have acheived a 18:49 mark , 1 second faster then Hruvlmps map24 demo. I believe that the hardest parts of this level are, 1. The two Cyberdemons near the blue door.
2. The part when you have to run in and get the red key (Been blasted to bits by the Viles here way more then once).

3. The end looks awsome but it isn't too bad if you still have the 2 invulnerabilites. I jack this part up in the demo , not one Cyber dies with the first one.

So , I think it's a nice map but now I'll stop playing it.
