Total time -  16:31

Time - my time in this run
hrdq - hrdq2843 time


map01: This was built recently. No way i could repeat this time without building,
so i just used the same demo.

map02: Another built run. I tried to make turns smoother here so it wouldnt look
THAT jerky. Spent quite a while on this map. At first i tried to record it using
two glides, and got 0:11 after few hours. It was a low 11sec, so it needed a little
refinement. While deleting unnecessary tics, i accidentaly pressed the tic with UT
in it. And you know what? DRE showed that i'm standing in the corner of this last
room and still reach the button from this place. Quick check in WadAuthor showed
that it is not a bug, but the button is just so "wide" :) I got 10:06 using this
trick but couldnt cut 3 more tics. The next morning i've rebuilt everything from
beginning (argh damn this glide) and it was enough to crash the limit and get 9:97 :)
(it appeared that Gusta already used the trick years ago, pity i didnt know about it earlier)

map03: Everything went ok here. Maybe i should have tried for 35s, but i'm more than
satisfied with the look of the run as it is now.

map04: Thanks to Grazza for pointing out this cool glide! Really unnoticable shortcut,
but very helpful :) In fact, it is very easy one to perform, i get it every ~10th try.
(compare with map02 one, for which i needed few hours). The run is quite consistent,
with no big troubles. 

map05: Yay, under 1min! :) Xit Vono's suggestion to avoid Hell Knight worked well, thanks
alot. It gave 4sec gain, and more improvement comes from better monster behaviour here and
there.

map06: I couldnt trick caco to move in a right place and lost a couple of tics going round
him, but still 0:39 feels too far away. 

map07: This one looks worse than 1:29 i made earlier. I could bombard the spider gathering
(near the start) more efficiently. The lone rocket, which i take in the end slowed me down
a bit too. Still - happy to cheat it 1 more second down =)

map08: I found a good way through lost souls. Wallrun and a rocket boost saved more than
1sec, and it allowed to get just under 0:17, which was my initial goal. There is also a
possible wallrun near 3 chaingunners, but i couldnt find any wholesome use of it. The 
lamp in this wall doesnt make any benefit of execution of the trick (slows you down),
and it seems that cutting the corner "normal" way is faster anyway.

map09: nic0r! :) In the beginning it looks like there is an easy way to avoid imps. I've
tried many combinations of movements, but they didnt let me through anyway. So they got
their dose of lead :P Plasma really helped on the way back, and special thanks go to
revenant for his little but useful help.

map10: You can get on the hedge (in the BK area) by using a rocket boost. Thing or
monster glide gives scanty speed, and lost soul's bite isn't enough either. On the 
other hand, hell knight's plasma ball gives enough boost if you are perfectly (or 
near perfectly) aligned, and running straight along the western wall. Theoretically
it is possible to do it, but i couldnt get it without cleaning out the place beforehand,
so back to normal route.

map11: Nice map to play for fun, but speeding it through is a pain! There are no tricks
to mention apart from a glide near an exit (saves 1sec), just trying to squeeze my way
through the hordes without BFG. And btw, AV jump from the start room up to where sargeants/
troopers are clustering is impossible.

map12: The level is dull and so is my run here. Nothing spectacular.

map13: Keygrab seems to be impossible afterall. I tried getting it with perfect angle, 
perfectly aligned (placing player1 start on the same y-coordinate as the key, and building
a 32-unit gap around myself so this coordinate remains the same after i start moving),
with a rocket boost, with turbo 255, and vice versa - approaching the key as slow as i could.
No way. So, like map11 it's pretty straight forward map.

map14: Bleh, this trick surely requires luck :) Thanks to Cameron Prosser for his awesome
idea. Southern arch-vile (number 84) is blocked by hell knights and baron, but in this run
he got released quite fast. I shoot the other AV while waiting for this one to get into
position. 0:08 is indubitably manageable, but gosh... i'm fed up of this map already :P

map15: Nothing to say really. Easy stuff with tool-assistance, spent maybe half of an hour
on this, and it doesnt look bad anyway.

map16: Running the whole map without armor and weapons would have been of no fun, so i
invented this neat route which allows to cut the boring parts :) I suggest to try doing it
unassisted, the time under 1:30 would be very good here.

map17: Using two known tricks here, and btw it's third map in a row that requires a glide =)

map18: Lack of BFG power leads to time loss in the beginning (i'm 5 secs behind hrdq after
barons' corridor) Taking plasmagun in map16 would allow for 1-2sec drop in the corridor, but
then i wouldnt have enough cells for the end part (revenants&spiders).
At first i used the basic route and got 1:32 with it. It was an ok time, because i managed
to go ahead of hrdq afterall using few rocket boosts and strafe50. However, i wasnt fully
satisfied with the time and went ahead to tweak the route a bit. Finally, i came to this
one. It cuts 30secs, allows to take BFG and looks nicer. Perfect =) You probably wonder what
the hell is going on in the end. I'll explain - there are 2 linedefs behind the arachnotrons.
The first one teleports the archie behind you, and the second one teleports you on the bridge
(which is lowered by this moment because i skipped half of the map). So the second linedef
*must* be passed in order to exit the map with this route. Well, i couldnt pass it in spite
of hours of trying... But there is a trick. At first i erroneously thought that if archie
teleports and enters the room, the 2nd linedef stops working and you can safely open the exit
door. The real case is different - the linedef is triggered by a revenant ball instead!
Huge thanks to RjY for the in-depth explanation of this phenomenon. I wonder if the trick can
find its use in other maps.

map19: Pretty easy and fast enough. Plenty of health all the time, so maybe i should have
added some rocket boosts and tried for 0:19. Couldnt find a place where to do it though.

map20: Very violent and tight map with no tricks, just a pure running and cells-wasting. 
I hate the mancubi&central places both forward and back ways, too many blockers everywhere.

map21: And another trickless map. Was quite boring to run it.

map22: Pure slaughter! Very fun to play :) Though i have to admit i was a bit scared of this
map earlier, thinking smth like "dame, what if i wont have enough health/cells or will get
blocked every step i take?" Everything went like a lightning here, happy with the time.
AV jump could have been done faster though.

map23: Didnt try this one hard. Frustrating map for speed (however, i really liked playing
coop UV-max here. That's one of my favourite maps for coop-play), so you'll see some bumps
here and there. Getting 1:32 isnt hard, but i didnt want to do it because current exact 
time is so leeet - 1:33,37 :D

map24: 0:09 is out of reach for me. So, it is just a copy of my recent TAS demo from scratch.
The only difference is that i take plasma and RL here. I also tried another style (the one
i used in hr24-010.lmp), but it leaves you with less health and isnt faster unless you
somehow manage to glide the imp line around. Had no luck with it.

map25: This map belongs to ones that are much harder to do in UV than in NM. I mean to do
it quick :) Spiders and cacos always move around and tend to stand in your way. Thats 
another map which is hard to do without BFG, so i have to run in inconvenient ways
sometimes. Though it doesnt slow me down, since i do it while waiting for some platform to
lower down (like roundabout way through the revenants to cybie). Revs that guard the BSK
bugged me alot, because they are really uncooperative in UV and blocked me badly all the
time. Thats why i also shoot 2 rockets whilst waiting for the teleport to lower. I think this
taught them a little lesson :P Luckily i had good monster positioning after taking the key
and teleporting back to the yard.

map26: Maybe with some rocket boost in the start, and perfect cooperation from AV you can 
get it as low as 0:03, but i doubt it is doable in a non-built demo. I actually tried to
make rocketjump off a demon, and even 2 consecutive rocketjumps (off a demon, then off a wall),
but couldnt make it fast enough to improve my 4secs here. To tell the truth, i didnt try
it hard, the map is rather annoying. This starry sky makes me feel very sleepy.

map27: I tried some variations in the route here, but they appeared to be not worth it. So
you'll see just a lonely strafe50 running around. Relaxing map.

map28: I'm damn sure it's optimal. Though i wont be sad at all if someone proves me wrong.

map29: Monsters behaved quite good. Earlier when i was making a run from scratch i had lots
of problems with fickle beasts (demons&revs,manco,barons, demons again, barons again), making
countless attempts to finally get nice positioning of them. Here i havent got any problems
coming from it (except the demons at :26), with what i'm pretty happy.

map30: Tried many route variations here, but AVs are not friendly (or maybe it's opposite?) on UV,
and i couldnt get a quadruple AV jump (though i succeded in doing it on Nightmare!). Triple AV jump
isnt possible either. I can get a jump itself, but there are quite a few problems later, which seem
to me quite unsolvable. Whatever, the time is ok anyway.


Little conclusion:
Making this movie was an incredible fun, mainly because HR is my favourite megawad of all time,
very tense and full of action, but still packed with plenty of various tricks. Hope the movie
fits it well ;) I had lots of enthusiasm & energy in the beginning - even after i had spent ~25hours
on maps06,07,08 and finally was told by Xit Vono about a shortcut in map05 i didn't become very upset
and immediately rerecorded everything. But of course there were times when i just wanted to give up
the whole idea of a run - e.g. when i reached map14 (and later the same happened at map23). So thanks
to all of you who encouraged me to go on and get the job done finally!
I have some plans on making another TAS movie in future, but not in the nearest time. Maybe after a
month or so... who knows? :)

Enjoy!
