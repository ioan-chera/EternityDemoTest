Whew, this was hard for me, to get 1 minute. Shows how much I suck at
this game. ;)

I wanted to go for 59 initially, but after progressing an hour and 30
minutes with repeating 1:01 times, I knew that I had to stop the insanity
and the wear and tear on my hands once I reached a minute. Yes, this is
a very unforgiving map in how much running is required without pauses at
certain points. Also, the backwards running I used can be a bit of a 
guessing game at times, though after you do this for about 20 minutes you
start to get used to how far backwards you should run, also cut corners 
tighter, running is a bit cleaner, etc. Over time, I was able to improve.

I got 2 1:01.09's before this and countless other failed attempts at a 
minute. I needed to cut 4 tics, and it looks like I was able to cut 5 here.

Good luck to anybody who tries for under a minute, and I hope you don't
hurt your hand too bad! :P
