Comments:  My first Tyson demo ever. Easy tyson, first exit on my first attempt!

Not a traditional tyson as I barely use the fist to kill a demon, but have everything die by infighting through tactical maneuvering and use the pistol towards the end. A faster time comes from unleashing the viles early and being daring, my strategy is to line myself up between a vile and a group of Mancubie so it quickly dies to a shower of fireballs.

The only challenging section is returning to the beginning stairway after the blue key, I hope their aren't many goats left over as it takes time to kill them through infighting due to their awkward positioning, as I need to save bullets for the Cyber at the end and any stragglers. This segment took a bit longer then expected due to the Archvile moving unpredictably and a lot of Revenants were left over.

I was hoping for sub 40 but seeing as this run was easy to get, I'll likely do another one.
