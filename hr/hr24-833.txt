  HR24-833.LMP - UV Max

  Recorded using PrBoom+ 2.4.8.1 -complevel 2
  
  Kills    106%
  Items     94%          
  Secrets  100%  and Time   8:33
                        
  Inspired by Ryback's recent -fast run, I combined elements of his route
  and Eugene's Compet-N max with some of my own ideas.

  Taking this under 8 minutes is definitely possible. There are some major
  screw-ups in the early part of the demo, unnecessary damage taken at 
  some of the cyber fights and unplanned safe plays at the archviles near the end.

  1st exit, I really wanted to improve upon it but I find that I have less
  and less free time to spend on Doom these days.
