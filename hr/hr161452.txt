Description             : 

Honestly, I cannot believe this is slower then Chris Ryback's current
COMPET-N record of 14:10. It's primarily the same route with a few 
new approaches to a couple areas.

1) IMO, The plasma/3 archie room is handled better. By teleporting back
and forth you can get continual shots between the enemies on both sides.
Instead of jumping off you can land 2 good SSG shots, then teleport back,
etc. My aim was pretty shoddy at this part in this demo though.

2) The red key area. Whereas Chris plays "ledge inspector" with the archvile
I just jump in. In this demo I fail to get an infight between the arch and
spider. Usually I can get them going and avoid a blast while I freeze the
others. Then I proceed to release the hounds (barons)! Again, all things seem
to have gone to shit in this demo and I have an awkward moment strafing for
my life. I think this also saves 1 trip Chris makes from circling around.

3) I use all my ammo. I don't understand how Chris could even exit with that
much ammo. I might put myself in a bad situation if I run out but he just 
stands to shave off another 20 or so seconds if he uses those 70 cells.

4) No IDDT. It may sound stupid, but Chris clearly uses IDDT before he 
exits. I don't know why: it's really not necessary on this level. He
could have had it under 14 mins if he didn't stop. 

All in all, I guess with these tricks a time of under 13 minutes could be
achieved. The final cleanup went really bad for me. Who knows how much time
I lost there (?). Perhaps Chris will see this and re-record? Otherwise, these
new approaches are going to fall in oblivion . . .
