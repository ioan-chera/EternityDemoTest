Comment: Well, I (Mattias) didn´t die, that´s the interesting part.
But thanks to my 486 for being so slow and making my pentium run doom slow but still smooth,
which the 486 didn´t do.
Yes, we stopped sometimes, that´s cause we talked what we should do.
I didn´t begin to take the "Don´t die" seriously until after the 2 cybies.
