wellll.. I was downloading various shite from the net.
had nothing better to do in the meantime. so I installed DooM.
and got this after 5 minutes. and just in time it seems.
(our University closes its doors at 10PM for all who care)

yep, these new terminals have fast connections, but the mouse input
is VERY jerky (or "jumpy" if you prefer). plus I' m rusty as hell.
played chicken on the twin towers too.
horrible demo in other words - dont watch it!
better play this map. I'm sure you could equal the maxtime here. 
just try..
