Pwad:      Hell Revealed by Yonatan Donner and Haggay Niv
Pwad name: hr.wad
Maps:      various
Skill:     3 (Hurt me plenty)
Category:  Max 
Exe:       Doom2.exe

As with all of my demos since 1995:
Completely vanilla setup with doom/doom2.exe, no cheats, source-ports(with the exception of a scant few MBF/Boom demos), or crutches.
native OS calls, no autorun, no mixed key binds, TSRs, or config cheats
This is the real game.

==========================
Most maps in HR on skill 3 are softer versions of skill 4.  However, a few are just slightly harder versions of skill 2.  Map24, for example, is much easier than UV.


Map01 - Map19 -- Mostly just first attempts to test out skill 3.

Map21 - Not a bad run, with a good route... much easier to optimize than UV.

Map22 - Map29 -- unoptimized test runs for UV practice.

Map30 - easy as a single map.

Map31 - Map32 -- unoptimized test runs for UV practice.
