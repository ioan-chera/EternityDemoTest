just for fun.
not an easy movie to push, but certainly not hard to do at my pace.
Adam be warned, I have a uv movie in the works...
farthest so far is to map14 in 2 1/2 hours. 
Don't worry, I won't send one until I make at least map20... but of course, that would be a 5 hour demo.  =P

considered going on, but since I missed 100% on map08 and 11 would be the first hard -fast map in the movie, I didn't.

a -fast movie would surely be more difficult for the other 2 episodes, but I know it could be done by several players.

as for nightmare movies:
ep1 -- 1 is easy, but 2 is a very hard challenge, 3 would definitely be hard -- much like e1m6, 4 would be relatively easy, 5 would be difficult, 6 would be quite hard since it all revolves around the center area -- and 7 is impossible, so it ends there.
ep2 -- too little ammo to make 11, I think. 12 would be very hard, and 13 is impossible.
ep3 -- 21 is a speedrun, but on 22, if by some miracle you managed to live through the first segment at the bridge, you'd never make it to the exit.
