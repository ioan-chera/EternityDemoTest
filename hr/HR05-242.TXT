Demo entry #109.

Description:

Lots of great plasma action which nicely harmonizes with the level design. The
whole map consists of cramped rooms, but they don't have many awkward structures
(such as odd angles or uneven ground), and are pure fun to run through.

Yonatan's 2:43 is one of my favorite HR TAS demos, but it's still far from
perfect, just like other TASes of the past century. I played the nasty beginning
carefully, without trying to replicate Yonatan's luck-manipulation with gunners,
but saved enough time in other parts, and reached my goal at the first exit.
