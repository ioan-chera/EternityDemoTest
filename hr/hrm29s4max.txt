Comments:
I love this map, music is just amazing, and despite I'm not so bad with
BFG 9000 I like that in this map there isn't BFG and you have to kill
all enemies with SSG or RL (keeping PR ammunition to fight twin cyber).
My time is not the best I can do however trying to get a good time in
this map takes a lot of time and tries which makes map tedious.
