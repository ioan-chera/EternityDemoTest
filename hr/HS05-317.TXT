Demo entry #91.

Description:

This is one of 12 "warm-up" maps, located at a very early stage of HR's
progress, but it's already a great level (though not as amazing as the ones in
episodes 2 and 3). It's different and yet similar to the UDoom episode which
inspired it, and it nicely fits the atmosphere of Hell Revealed.

Time is kinda slow -- this NM "Speed" run is longer than Yonatan's TAS max
(2:43), but it's excusable in this kind of a map, which requires a large amount
of backtracking through corridors filled with respawning enemies (hence such a
high number of kills). 

My first exit was extremely far from satisfying (3:43). This second-survival
demo is reasonably good, though still more or less shaky, because of how hectic
the run is.

Anyone for under 2:43? :-)
