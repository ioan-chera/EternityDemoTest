I love the WAD hell revealed, and I was poking around on some maps (this was
one of them of course ;D) and I was trying to find all the secrets for what-
ever reason. (I think this is a cool, traditional MAP24, and I haven't play-
ed it in a while, so I figured I'd try to find all the secrets. Then, in the
second secret (with the BFG and that platform with all the pillars), I won-
dered if strafe-jumping would be possible to that platform with the switch. I
tested it a little, and decided it was not (unless you used permanenet S50 or
something, which I don't use; actually, I don't use strafe-50 at all... just
my trusty keyboard :D). Then, I wondered about a rocket jump from one of the
pillars. I tested it a bit, and to my amazement, I was actually able to per-
form it rather well, and I suck at rocket jumps! :) Needless to say, the jump
is very easy, but it's still one of those either-you-get-it-or-you-don't sce-
narios. ;) This took about 5 tries. XD And I can't believe how much time it
saves... I beat the previous record by 1 minute and 5 seconds, even if it was-
n't really meant to be TOO fast... oh well, nice record for me. ;D
