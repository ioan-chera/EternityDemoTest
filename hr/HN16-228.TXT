Demo entry #103.

Description:

The biggest HR level in geometrical size. Superb grand design, with a grim, wild
and oppressive feel. Brilliant for speedrunning, especially on NM.

In January 2010 this run was quite a bitch for me, but now, with higher movement
skills, it became much less frustrating. Time improvement is caused by faster
running and a more detailedly balanced route. I leave the megasphere for the
ending, which allows to blast through the final scenes more drastically and
with a bigger success rate. On the other hand, I take a longer and safer path
from the blue key to the blue sphere.

Demo took me a very little effort, especially compared to my 3 latest UV Maxes.
First exit in only 2 hours, with some natural flaws in the running, but 2:28 is
just what I was aiming for.

Enjoy the nightmare!
