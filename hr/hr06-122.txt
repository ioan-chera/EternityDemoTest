  YEAH !
  After one hour and 239 tries I did it !

  Archie have many frags, ´cause I play
  with OFFSOUND, ´cause I play in WIN 2k
  from now on.

  So this one is my premiere lmp recorded
  in WINDOWS 2000, and it not last - sure.

  and 21 in this megawad. And I have 29
  lmps for HR (26 singlemaps, 3 movies).
