Demo entry #71.

Description:

Here is my first regular UV Max for HR, on one of my beloved levels.

not a difficult level."

When playing it at a faster pace, without wasting much time for defense, it's
far from "not difficult", for me at least. The first spiderdemon usually
refuses to cooperate (which leads to instant death), and the rest is also full
of similar risky spots. After 24-28 hours, I got more or less used to these
loads of hairy parts, and it became a bit easier to survive the entire fragfest.

This is the first acceptable result (under Peo's TAS time, 9:24). My previous
exits were 9:45, *censored*:05 and 9:41, due to lame monster cooperation and
extra-shaky performance in the second half. Don't know if my route is the
fastest one, but I'm sure that even 8:XX is reachable with really hard work.

As for Peo's long TAS max demos, they aren't even remotely perfect, and cannot
compete with his excellent HT10-456, for instance. His HR17-924 has a number
of noticeable slowdowns and other unoptimized actions. If the TAS for MAP17
was recorded by Esko, I think it would be 7:40-8:40, judging by his playing in
HR15-654 :-)
