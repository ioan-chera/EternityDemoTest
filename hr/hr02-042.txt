  [Compet-N entry #132]

  So, after my TAS lmp for Tool Assisted Speedruns
  (0:42 - yeah I´m lame) I wanted to get close to
  the optimal time (it will be about 0:3x).
  Again I didn´t succeeded to jump from than
  someimps-shotgunner-ssg-switch room :)
  Lot of errors, under :40 possible. Enjoy...
