Description:

I uploaded my 1:14 back in late May of this year, and I remember Catalaá saying it
was slow. At that time, I didn't think anything of it. But just recently, I believe
Qwerty and I, and maybe Vono I think, were discussing demos that we had done. I said
that he30-114 was really horrible, and I think Qwerty disagreed and said it was
good.

So, to Qwerty: THIS is good :)

Not my last demo of the year I hope.

I didn't really work much on this demo either, maybe 3 hours at most. I was just
waiting for a run in which I got 2 rockets in on the first trip up the lift. I also
had a :51 and a :50 but neither had 100% kills...I think it was in the low 90%
though.

So yeah...I like this demo, it doesn't look like crap either, and it wasn't as
difficult as it was 7 months ago ^_^
