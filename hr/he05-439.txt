  Hell Revealed – Map 5 – UV Respawn

Comments:
After checking out Xit Vono's NM run, I knew that this would be possible. And it shows. It's basically just the NM run, but quicker due to it being normal -respawn. There shouldn't be any worrying when it comes to getting 100% kills, as most of the enemies have to be killed anyway but since it takes more time to kill them again, it just adds more time.
