A somewhat cool map that is a complete 
disaster to max due to crappy monster 
behavior dependance, especially on cyber 
in BFG room. He rarely infights and 
usually does nothing. If you're
wondering, of course he did completely 
nothing during my only first exiter as 
well. In ggg's demo cyber completely 
cleaned out that room, so if you're 
feeling like wasting your life for a 
lucky gamble, around 9 should be doable.
