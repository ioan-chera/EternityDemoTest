Cool map, for some reason a desire came over me to record a nomonsters
demo for this beast. You can see that the demo is still somewhat sloppy
in parts and that a couple seconds can be shaved with just better SR40
running, but this is my best demo out of quite a few attempts, so that's
what's here.
