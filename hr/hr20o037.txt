Well, I was hoping to have a nomo run of all of tnt released by my birth-
day (October 18), but because I'm being a semi-perfectionist on that first 
episode (most of those maps I don't really like anyway.. I really like
episodes 2 and 3 of tnt though) it didn't work out.

After trying for about an hour tonight, but failing somewhere in the first
episode of tnt, I decided to try a single level run real quick to get my
motivation back up (which I can actually lose pretty quickly :/). I got
this on my THIRD try and can't seem to improve it enough to get a 36. It's
also 100% secrets like the other 2 nomonsters runs up, only 10 seconds
faster. :)

Humorously enough, after the 37.97 demo I recorded, I got another .97 demo
using a rocket boost trick (but it's slower than 37). I mean the demo JUST
after the 37.97 demo, heh. The rocket jump could be quite useful in perhaps
a TAS run, but for a normal nomonsters run, it seems that the wall is too
far to the left to get the RJ straight from SR40-ing down the stairs, which
means you'd have to slow down to do it in a normal run, I think. It was just
another idea I had that I tested for fun. :)
