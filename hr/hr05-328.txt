  Description:  This is a pretty crappy first exit, but the beginning of this level annoys me too much from a recording standpoint to improve it.  By far the worst part is the ending where I finish the baron with the chaingun.  Even if I don't enjoy recording on this map, it is still one of my favorite maps from Hell Revealed.  I remember when I first started playing doom I thought this map was super hard because I would always run out of ammo.
