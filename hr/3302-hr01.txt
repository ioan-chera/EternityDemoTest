Comments: 

Map 01- I died here the most and redundency made this my least enjoyed map. 
I tried many different strategies including tyson and uv-max records but the end time often was the same.
I decided to play it safe and straight forward saving my rockets for map 02.

Map 02- Limited health made this one of the tougher maps. I put the most practice and planning into this map.
I decided to rush for the sgg and use 2 rockets from map 1 to help clear the jump afterwards. 
With all the practice i put in my success rate was pretty high getting past this map easily.
This was one of my fastest times and i didn't even to bother to pick up 2 medkits at the end.
 
Map 03- Everything went great here. I've lost quite a few runs by missing that stupid secret platform.
Odds are if a run gets through this map then i'm going to finish.

Map 04- Went ok but i had to detour because i was low in health. Most my improvement came from following
the UV-Max route

Map 05- Love maps with cramped rooms and crowds of weak monsters to plow through. It reminds me of
AV04, one of my favorite maps. This was a pretty fast time but i had trouble in the plasma room and
i missed the plasma grab so i could have probably saved 10+ secs.

Map 06- Hate this map, nobody wants to peck away at all these hordes of 2-3 barons with a shotgun it gets so tedious.
This map would be much better if they were just hell knights. Most the time saved was agressive play by clearing
out the 1st section with the plasma rifle.

Map 07- This map was the big time saver from all the other previous records. I didnt understand why all the
previous record holders just used ssg on this massive horde of spiders. I only needed cells for one other part
and that was to make a dash on map 09. My strategy was to dump most my cells and a fair amount of rockets
on the initial herd. Not only was this faster it was significantly safer.

Map08- Love the imps with the diving deaths at the begining lol

Map 09- Love this map, lot of fun. Caught a surprise rocket but time was fast

Map 10- Damn, wish i would have shaved off 2 secs somewhere

Enjoy the movie!
