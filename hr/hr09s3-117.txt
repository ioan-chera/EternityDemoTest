Why Skill 3? you may ask at first. Well, skill 3 has the plasma rifle that's 
real nice for blazing through a group of monsters, and you get the RL by the
YK, so you can perform the death slide at the end.
I didn't really spend much time on this... probably my 5th attempt or so. I
just played this because it's extremely fun! :D
