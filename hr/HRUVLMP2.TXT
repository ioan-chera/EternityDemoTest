This is the new lmp set for Hell Revealed. All lmps were recorded on
skill 4 (Ultra-Violence), killing every monster and finding every secret, as
quickly as possible. The time improvement over the first set is huge!
(Many of the lmps are twice as fast as the original ones, and even more!)

All of the demos are new! Even the ones we thought were already unbeatable,
we managed to beat!

A few comments:

In level 26 there is a bug with the ghosts - sometimes there aren't any
ghosts in the end. This happens randomly and that's why it wasn't discovered
before. Kai recorded a 33:09 lmp but unfortunately there were no
ghosts in his lmp. Peo recorded a 41:05 lmp with ghosts. We include both
lmps. Note that both of them are faster than the old lmp.

We include two demos for level 30, one without 100% kills and one with 100%
kills. The reason is that in level 30, many of the kills are monsters that
are spawned, so it is arguable that kill don't really matter in such a
level. However, for people who do care, there is also a demo with 100% kills
included.

And now the really cool part! We are including a special bonus:

We are also including lmps for 21 out of the 32 levels in Hell Revealed
recorded with the -fast option, which makes the levels even more difficult!
Those demos aren't all super speedy, but we're sure you will enjoy them.
They are also recorded on Ultra-Violence with 100% kills and secrets, of
course. If you can do any more HR maps with -fast, please let us know. We're
even including a demo of level 1 done with -fast and in "tyson" mode - using
only the pistol and the fist.

To playback these demos, put them in your doom2 directory and type:
  doom2 -file hr.wad -playdemo hr??-uv
For levels 26 and 30, there is also:
  doom2 -file hr.wad -playdemo hr??-uv2
For the -fast lmps:
  doom2 -file hr.wad -playdemo hr??fast
For the level 1 -fast tyson lmp:
  doom2 -file hr.wad -playdemo hr01-tgm

?? is the level number.
