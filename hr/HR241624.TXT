Hmmm, didn't ever think I'd get this time. I had a 16:09, but I wasn't 
recording. DAMN!!! Oh well, I'd have to say that Post Mortem is my all-
time favorite Doom2 level. I love the final battle. All those Barons and
Mancubi. The 5 cyberdemons are pretty good at clearing out the red key 
area for you. I always save the 2 invulns, specifically for that part of
the map. If not you have a great chance of dying. The two rising Cybies 
near the blue door are also pretty hard to deal with. Many a-time they 
made me meet my maker. Anyhow think its an awesome level and I'm glad that
I've finally got the record. For now anyway... :)
