comments:  15 minutes job - no surprise since at my pace you just can't die - 
           9:xx (or 8:xx ;) shouldnt be too hard to reach, having monsters
           killing each other obviously helps.. in this lmp I loose time with the
           spiders in the tiny room, but was pretty lucky at the redkey.. 
           I saved way too many cells, guess next time I'll have to spend them 
           somewhere.. :->

           forgive me the bad moves and unexpected turns btw, but recording at
           a University terminal has a few drawbacks (umn)

           of course full route credits go to Esko and Anders, which happen to
           be my 2 favourite -fast madmen, isnt that a funny coincidence? :o)
