
these few demos were recorded just for fun in the good old HR -fast tradition:
keep your first (or second) successful try w/o trying to be supersuperspeedy..

additionally I played in a hostile territory - at a uni terminal that is ;)

I might try some more maps (08.. 12.. 32.... 23 :P) once back from the dark side
(next october/november) - hopefully I'm still interested in doom by then (sorry
for rambleing btw)
