Pwad:      Hell Revealed by Yonatan Donner and Haggay Niv
Pwad name: hr.wad
Maps:      various
Skill:     4 (Ultraviolence)
Category:  Max 
Exe:       Doom2.exe

As with all of my demos since 1995:
Completely vanilla setup with doom/doom2.exe, no cheats, source-ports(with the exception of a scant few MBF/Boom demos), or crutches.
native OS calls, no autorun, no mixed key binds, TSRs, or config cheats
This is the real game.

There is a single prboom-plus demo(hr24-1031.lmp) in here too.
==========================

Map01 - Map10 -- Mostly just first exits.  Map05 is slower than my previous record.

Map21 - Some rocket surfing.  Entire run requires monster cooperation.  5:00 would be a good time.

Map23 - First exit. Nothing special at all.

Map24 - With Richie, Chris, and Przemys³aw's route improvements, Map24 drops from very hard to medium-hard.  I got the 15:54 easily... hard to keep driving every second of the demo as lots of monsters are in flux due to variable monster infighting(and how fast you try to push through the map).  The 13:12 is doom2.exe; apparently making it the Compet-N record.  The 10:31 is actually recorded with prboom-plus-2.4.8.2 -- I would shrug that off as coincidence, but even Richie's demos are faster with prboom as well.  In a map like this, seeing clearly at a distance is important for map control.  When you return to the top with the invulnerability, you need to clear the way to the exit, kill the Cybers, and optimally clear the SMM/archvile room.  Getting lucky with the archviles in the beginning and getting lucky with clearing the middle with the invulnerability are the keys to a lower time.  Belial's record is very nice.

Map25 - Fun, quick, and easy max run.  Fun to play over and over.  I'll take being third behind these two DOOM gods.  Getting 4:xx is probably not too hard, just requires more Cyber cooperation.  4:14 is very nice.

Map31 - Map is quite fickle... not wimping out at the start can cause more problems than it is worth.  In the 9:14 demo, I take the normal exit.

Map32 - I watched my old run and it is not 100%(5 monsters short in the HK towers)... so I looked into other demos.  Happy to see that Anders' 4:14 demo is a legitimate 100%(It only misses the 40 PEs, but they are really out of the map).  I'm surprised Yonatan didn't notice or fix that issue when playtesting it.  Chris mentions this issue in one of his fantastic demosets.
My new 6:52 run is a true 100%.
