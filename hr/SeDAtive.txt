all seriousness aside..
Time is P-A-thetic I know, but here's my alibi

-) the first spider was on steroids, but the first baron wasn't ;)
a) it's just a 10 min effort (ahh, the good old HR -fast tradition..)
b) I wasn't wearing my golden necklage (forgot it at home, damn)
c) additionally I run out of chewing gum (argh!)
d) the first 9 cybs are mucho fun, the rest however is pretty dull - especially the ending room.
   19 out of 20 tries, the arseviles will hide from you and go into a time-consuming
   "fatso-respawn-loop". The one time they don't, you'll step into the exit "by accident". 
   Obviously, I'm makin' assumptions - I could never be arsed to play it 20 times, y'know..
e) all my downloads arrived, so I'm outta here! ("good riddance")




cheers to ANDY (for some route ideas) and DOUG (his hr281xxx started it all, so he's
the one to blame;) - and thanks Ante Smolcic for sending me zerovert.com back in late 99
Esko's MBF recording is groovy too and TNT's map31 music is wonderful
