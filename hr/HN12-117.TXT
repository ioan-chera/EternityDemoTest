Description:

This level is not as exciting as 11 or 13, but still a good introduction to the
second episode. Great fun to speed through.

Peo's TAS run obviously contained quite a lot of redundant actions, and beating
it was on my to-do list for a long time. At first it seemed very frustrating to
me, but later I discovered that it's easier to rush the map with minimum amount
of detours to powerups. Getting the BFG is not worth the trouble. So the result
is much lower than my initial target (sub-2:00).

A relatively easy and comfortable run, even though significant luck is
necessary. Lots of goodies, but the slightest imperfection in monster behavior
can ruin your health instantly.

This took a very little effort, only one morning-session. Nice first exit, some
confusion early in the run, but the time is faster than what I was aiming for --
around 1:26, which is 1/6 of Peo's TAS time :-)
