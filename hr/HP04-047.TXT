Demo entry #35.

Description:

IMO the first really beautiful level in HR. It's colorful and detailed design
is much more realistic than on most other Doom levels of that time, plus it's
done with HR's unique atmosphere in mind!

The 7 second improvement is caused by my new approach to the keyed doors: don't
lure out the heavy weapon dudes, just push the switches straight through them.
It's of course dangerous and it depends on luck how quickly you can do it, so it
was hugely difficult to pull off this trick 2 times in a single attempt plus
avoid running out of health or getting stuck in the rest of the run.

My target was below 0:50, but when I reached 0:49, the demo turned out so ugly
(with missing the final key) that I kept trying for a lower time or at least for
a better looking 0:49 :-) Finally here is an ultra-lucky attempt. My health was
remaining incredibly high, making the run look thousands of times easier than it
was for me.

I'll definitely return to HR in the future, it's my most favorite wad.
