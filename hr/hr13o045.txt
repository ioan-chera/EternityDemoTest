My goal was 45 and I achieved it quickly. :)

There are some errors so 43 or 42 should be possible using SR40 only like
I did. However, this is .97, so I'm kinda too lazy to push it any more. :P

That BSK sneak grab trick isn't hard, but it's annoying for a speedrun 
when you try to be quick. I got it on the second attempt, so time can of
course be cut there.

Nice map.
