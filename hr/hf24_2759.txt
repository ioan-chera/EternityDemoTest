Pwad:      Hell Revealed by Yonatan Donner and Haggay Niv
Pwad name: hr.wad
Maps:      various
Skill:     4 (Ultraviolence)
Category:  Max -fast
Exe:       Doom2.exe

As with all of my demos since 1995:
Completely vanilla setup with doom/doom2.exe, no cheats, source-ports(with the exception of a scant few MBF/Boom demos), or crutches.
native OS calls, no autorun, no mixed key binds, TSRs, or config cheats
This is the real game.

==========================

Map24 - I use Chris' awesome record as a template.  His brave style of playing is beyond me.  This is just a first exit. (living long enough to reach the right-side teleporter is not easy -- or rather, the map doesn't often cooperate enough for you to reach it.  If you do, you're almost home.)
