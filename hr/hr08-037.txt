  [57th Compet-N entry]

  What do you mean now about Selim´s 0:48 ?! :)

  But here is still room for 0:36 or 0:35, so
  who have problem with first sentence, he can 
  try it...

  Speedrunning in SSGpasage can be very helpful -
  kill first gunner, take his SG and after this
  take SSG and GO!
  Good luck.
