Comments: I got the bug again :)
                                
HF142329: New record by 3:41. Not destined for the compet-n though, as
          the last few minutes are very wonky - I start missing jumps and
          playing cute. And Esko's v. stylish demo deserves a better
          challenger...
HF151916: The demo that got me recording. I was thinking about Claudio's
          classic run here and wondering if I could beat it. This is a
          minute slower, but I reckon I could with some better map
          knowledge at the end. The route was made up on the fly,
          no reference to any other demo. And I can see what he means
          about it being a good level for -fast :)
HF19-313: Another Claudio route. compet-n record, and also beats Claudio's
          time. It *may* be possible to get a 2:xx using this route,
          but a lot of luck is needed in the second half of the level.
HF221313: New record by 1:45. Could have been a minute faster if I hadn't
          chickened out at the PEs. That's a dangerous situation, so I
          backed off. But otherwise the run went smoothly.
HF25-513: Left both cybers out to handle the teleporting imps and demons,
          and they did a fantastic job. I hardly had to lift a finger
          at the end. New compet-n record by 43 seconds.
HF28-747: Just an attempt to push my last recording for this level.
          Wasn't hard.


Yep, I think I like this WAD :)
