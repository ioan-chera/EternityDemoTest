Pwad name: hr.wad
Maps:      various
Skill:     various
Category:  Max and -fast
Exe:       Doom2.exe

As with all of my demos since 1995:
Completely vanilla setup with doom/doom2.exe, no cheats, source-ports(with the exception of a scant few MBF/Boom demos), or crutches.
native OS calls, no autorun, no mixed key binds, TSRs, or config cheats
This is the real game.

There is a single prboom-plus demo in here too.
==========================

Picked DOOM back up in 2016.  I haven't played more than a few minutes here and there for nearly 10 years.  It is remarkable how much of HR I have forgotten.  I've been watching some demos and recording some single map levels to recall the routes and re-learn the maps.  I'm still very rusty, but I do manage some new single map records of mine.

I had been wanting to re-visit HR since my previous HR compilation... finally to do Map24... and hopefully a UV max movie... and have some fun playing DOOM once again.  

I provided a more comprehensive HR html table... I'm not 100% certain it is fully accurate or complete.  And there are some miscellaneous demos that are intentionally missing.

The misc/junk demos are two buffer overflow demos and a couple fun oddities on Map24.
