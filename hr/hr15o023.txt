Description: Another nomo HR with a glide (together with two standard switch tricks). This could be used to quicken up the UV/NM speed runs, obviously. The glide occurs in a slightly odd way in this demo (between the teleport base and the railing, rather than the gap I am trying to get through, but it still means I can walk unobstructed through that gap), and I lose a good half second before I realize it.
