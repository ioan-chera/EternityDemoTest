Comments:
This map was very easy but this is not a good run, while I was fighting
revenants I felt that I've could get a better strategy to get a good time
moreover, I lost a lot of seconds trying to fight cyberdemons on differents
zones of the map (which would make be too easy the job), however,
I don't feel guilty to kill hell knights before entering to zone where
blue key is, thanks to that, I was able to calm down and focus to kill
chaingunners and wait to door to open up.

BTW, This was my first try of speedrun in this map and it succeded
at the first time which makes me happy because before join to
DSDA I wasn't capable to beat this map even with saved games =)
