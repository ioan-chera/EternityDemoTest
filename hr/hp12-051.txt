Description:
[Last Week] I got 55 pretty quickly (these are not yet pacifist, only UV) then many
runs and nothing. I took a break, came back and got 53 and was already happy
with it. I just did a couple more runs for fun and got 53:06. I just HAD to do 52
which took many hours probably because of too much trying. It was until then I
realized this could be "easily" done as pacifist in 50/51. I was a bit frustrated 
because of wasting so much time doing UV only, so I sat again for many hours.
Of course all I got was backache so I had a week break.

[Today] After being awake for 24 hours (because of my witty way to fix my sleep 
pattern...) I decided to try again. Couple runs and voilà: an ok run in 51. It did
leave a little craving for 50 or even 49 though, as last week I had some smooth 
tries but mancubi were not cooperative... 

Included one of my good failures, which was ~couple seconds faster to the
mancubi, just to show 50 should not be too though and 49 might be human too.

And thanks for Radeck Pecka and his 58 demo for showing me the basics of 
getting past the spidy first time. I tried to make it a science, but it sometimes
had it's own thoughts.
