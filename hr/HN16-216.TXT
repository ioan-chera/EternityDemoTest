Demo entry #111.

Description:

An extremely fun run through a huge magnificent level, so I decided to play it
for the THIRD time. Now I tried to go for true aggression, eliminating the
redundant delays and detours of my 2:28 run.

First exit again, and I didn't expect a whole 12-second improvement over my
recent record. Demo turned out the way I wanted -- some natural slow/ugly bits
don't disturb me. The straferunning is much more daring than in HN16-228 -- in
particular, I was lucky to survive that direct rush through final scenes.
