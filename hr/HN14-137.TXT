Demo entry #22.

Description:

Yet another exciting masterpiece from HR. It's of course a serious challenge on
skill 5, but compared to HN13 it is like Heaven compared to Hell.

In 2007, soon after HN13-223, I recorded HN14 in 1:51. In 2010 I decided to do
it with a more unordinary and risky route: going to the blue key without
invulnerability, and saving it for passing the next building more quickly.

The goal here was to go below Xepop's UV Speed record (1:40). This demo has some
slow clumsy movements after the blue door, otherwise not bad.

P.S. It really was a lucky Monday! Doing two demos in one day is very rare for
me, but on January 25 I managed to pull out THREE in a day: HN16-254, HR16-210,
HN14-137.
