Well, I hope no one is upset about this.

This is map28, extracted, then modified.
Only changes are all multi-player only items are now in single
player too.

I had this idea as a HR anniversary contest... 
but several things stood in my way:
1) most of the maps don't have multi-player items.
2) most of the maps are actually easier with the added monsters
(try map07 if you don't believe me)
3) I can't play the real maps, much less the harder versions.

so this very poor example demo is the result.
First try on the new version, so I run around trying to figure out where to use my ammo...

(Initially, I wasn't going to re-add all the megaspheres, but then it wouldn't be Yonatan's incarnation, so I made a straight modification.)

ps. Where's HR2?
