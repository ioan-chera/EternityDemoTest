Descriptions
------------
                                
HR-01 - Into the Gate
---------------------
Not much to say... it's easy, you can play as badly as I did and still
make it. Only 21s slower than the hruvlmps time, I was very surprised...

HR-02 - Gateway Lab
-------------------
Great level. Design is a bit bland, but the gameplay is what counts.
It really has that classic Episode 1 feel to it. Demo is a bit better too -
nice moves at the start.

HR-03 - The Dumpster
--------------------
Another small, easy, monster packed level. Some very bad aiming here...

HR-04 - The Garden Terminal
---------------------------
A demo from my early crap period. Watch me get into enormous ammo and
health difficulties no competent doomer would have to worry about, and then
wince at the terrible time (much worse than hruvlmps) It's probably Hell
Revealed's worst level, but even it didn't deserve this kind of treatment...

HR-05 - Core Infection
----------------------
Simple, bit uninteresting - sorta like the demo. I play the start
aggressive (surprisingly) but things slow from there - still not far outside
the hruvlmps time...

HR-06 - The Round Crossroads
----------------------------
The first HR level with some real complexity, the central area looks good
and is well designed. Also not far outside the hruvlmps time, despite me
deciding to berserk bash some imps for absolutely no reason...

HR-07 - Arachnophobia
---------------------
The first tough map in Hell Revealed, says Yonatan, and he's not wrong.
I could barely do this ten months ago. Finally I came up with a safe route,
clear out one leg and then duck in and out to avoid the main group of
spiders. Unfortunatly, this resulted in a very long, boring lmp.

HR-08 - The Jail
----------------
Played the ammohoarder way. This level is a good example of why HR is great -
no stunning design, no intricate puzzles or impossible secrets, just
solid design and plenty of monsters to kill...

HR-09 - Knockout
----------------
This is the level that taught me to box... It was tough all the way through,
and at the end an ammo shortage forced me to punch the Archvile - not ideal.
Still, faster than Yonatan in hruvlmps.

HR-10 - Chambers of War
-----------------------
Pretty similar to HR08, the lighting sets the atmosphere perfectly.
This is an old lmp, my playing style looks really strange. Got myself
into trouble stupidly, pretty funny really...

HR-11 - Underground Base
------------------------
Great level. Varied, exciting gameplay, original design. Unfortunately the
lmp isn't as good. It's VERY wimpy a LOT of the time. Plus there's a
five minute pause... sorry about that.

Strange scene: watch as a rocket hits a lamp and blows up in my face! Well,
that's what it looks like anyway.

HR-12 - Great Halls of Fire
---------------------------
Pretty forgettable map really... I certainly forgot the red key, which
led to a pretty scary scene at the Spider... /me lucky.

HR-13 - Last Look at Eden
-------------------------
Peo's classic recording of this from the first HR collection inspired me
to try this level. It's a beautiful level, but very tough, one of the
toughest in HR, even with all the tricks. Ten minute pause after the start.
Maybe I'll record this one again...

HR-14 - City in the Clouds
--------------------------
Aargh! Where are all the weapons?, you'll probably be thinking when you first
get to this level. It gets easier as you clear the monsters out, though.
Let em all fight each other, the monster placement is perfect for this.
My jumping is very bad here - took a few tries to get the plasma rifle,
then ten minutes - I am not joking - to get the BFG. Very cautious playing.
Some white knuckle stuff against a Cyberdemon :)

HR-15 - Gates to Hell
---------------------
Whew. I remember this being very tough. Watch my incredible circle
strafing technique :) The highlight of this lmp for me comes near the start,
the archvile resurrected a sargeant only for the ungrateful sargeant to
turn and kill him! I avenged Archie quickly enough...

HR-16 - The Path
----------------
Boring lmp of a boring level... The long periods when I'm not doing anything
I'm waiting for infights to make things easier.

HR-17 - The Black Towers
------------------------
By this stage I was starting to get used to HR difficulty. Everything went
find except the archvile trap - ran out of rockets, not a good time to do
so. Used Peo's trick of trapping the Cyberdemons at the door.

HR-18 - Hard Attack
-------------------
Pretty easy map, there's always somewhere to duck and cover so you can play
the whole map corner inspector style. Despite a lot of time wasting, and
running out of ammo at the end, this still beats Peo's lmp in hruvlmps by 24
seconds...

HR-19 - Everything Dies
-----------------------
Nice, short level, plenty of ammo, violent gameplay - great level.

HR-20 - Judgement Day
---------------------
I go Peo's way in hruvlmps - a very easy level. The end, though, is pretty
violent. One of my favourite areas in the whole game.

HR-21 - Siege
-------------
Ummm... gee that final area is hard.

HR-22 - Resistance is Futile
----------------------------
Great action packed level, it used to give me a lot of trouble. So I played
it conservatively the first time through. Six months later, I tried again
on Daniel's route... got 19:10 very easily.

HR-23 - Ascending to the Stars
------------------------------
Awesome design, insanely hard... IMO this is harder than 24. There are so
many places to die and you need all sorts of skills to make it through
the level. The lmp isn't bad, slow in parts, but you'd expect that by
now :)

HR-24 - Post Mortem
-------------------
This isn't the hardest level in HR. I thought it was, until I tried
recording it. It only took five tries or so. Luck really isn't a factor -
get all the weapons at the start and there's nothing to stop you from
making it that very run. Except for the two teleporting Cyberdemons you're
never trapped in a room with unfriendly monsters. The level itself is
brilliant. It's the thematic centrepiece of Hell Revealed, and far better
than the level that inspired it, Plutonia 24.

HR-25 - Dead Progressive
------------------------
Not as easy as I was hoping - I had to play very conservatively to finally
make it. The later lmp is much more aggressive.

HR-26 - Afterlife
-----------------
This is the hardest map in HR, no contest. 24 and 32 aren't even in the
same ballpark. All the battle arenas are femme fatales... beautiful but
deadly. I'm slower than the average 40mins or so most lmps for this level are
because of some slower playing at the Cyberdemon - revenant scene (died here
often) and because of my technique for handling the archviles in the
blue-black room. I died there three times trying to get them to kill each
other, which was hugely frustrating, which prompted the alteration of the
route. Now it's very safe, but you have to wait longer. And last, the ghost
monsters didn't appear at the end, unfortunately, except for one ghost imp
who appeared from nowhere and mysteriously disappeared again (I checked
the automap - that's what I'm doing at the end). Maybe I telefragged him.
Can you telefrag ghost monsters?


HR-27 - Cyberpunk
-----------------
Anders has done some great recordings for this level... The maze is tedious,
but looks good. My time is exactly the same as Yonatan's in the first HR
collection - I'm slower most places, but killed the Cybers from closer
range...

HR-28 - Top Hell
----------------
Great, open level, lots of ammo and lots of things to kill with it...

HR-29 - Temple of Fear
----------------------
Quite enjoyable to run through, it has however the most vicious secret in
all of Doom history - I used the automap, and I'm not ashamed to admit it...

HR-30 - Hell Revealed
---------------------
This is very tough, and the only level where I didn't get 100% kills (it's
meaningless on this level). The time is quite good, however, and the ending
was very surprising - I thougt I'd only hit the brain twice...

HR-31 - The Descent
-------------------
There is a trick to avoid fighting in the lift, and I use it. Make a cup of
coffee while you're waiting. I didn't get 100% secrets here - the last jump
was just too tough.

HR-32 - Mostly Harmful
----------------------
This one's not so hard, certainly much easier than, say, 23. There's
always something happening, which makes it a great level to record for.
Good level to practise your BFG usage on.
