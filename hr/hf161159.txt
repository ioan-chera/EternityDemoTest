  Description:
  Recorded this one a couple of weeks after my maxkill run on this
  level, while the routes were still fresh, then sat on it. Most 
  of the run is the same, save having to kill the Spider early on.
  Infights help you here a lot more compared to UV max, but on the
  other hand you've got to be more wary of some packs of monsters, 
  particularly the Mancubii around the blue key. Probably you could
  push this to be close to the maxkill record, I think I'd like to
  see that run.
  
  Thanks to kraflab for a Doomworld contest idea that finally gave
  me a reason to upload. Maybe I'll dust off the old win98 machine
  and give the old game a try again :)
