  Description :-)

  [Compet-N entry #143]

  Ehm, exact time is bitch, it´s 19.20 or so...
  I can be really really satisfied with 19.91 but not
  with this.
  
  I tried some other routes. Hr21-021 route (QWERTY) -
  my best time here was 20 secs, that tied up method´s
  run of course.
  Opulent´s hr04-025 route, here it was really nice 23
  secs. That route don´t use archiejump.

  With this route I can´t say what will be optimal, but
  I´m sure that 17 or 16 is possible. No discusion about
  "is 18 possible?"...

  All credits goes to method for route improvements.
  Well, sorry method, that I stolen your only HR point,
  but Hell Revealed Speed tables will be owned :)
