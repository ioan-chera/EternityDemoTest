Descriptions
------------

The descriptions were written by the team member who recorded the map.

HR-01 - Into the Gate
---------------------
I let some monsters fight each other and punched some demons and ended up
having lots of ammo.

Something is hidden in this level, which is not revealed in the infopack and
not counted as a secret, so I don't show it here... see if you can find it!

HR-02 - Gateway Lab
-------------------
One of my earliest levels, I still like it. There are no difficult areas.

HR-03 - The Dumpster
--------------------
Another of my earliest levels. Very easy. In coop it's possible to take the
yellow key early.

HR-04 - The Garden Terminal
---------------------------
My part of the map is the garden (the start of the level), Haggay's part is
The Terminal (the area after you teleport). It's very easy.

HR-05 - Core Infection
----------------------
Some people think it's too complex, I find it very simple though. I take the
plasmagun here in the easiest way, thanks to John Keniry for the idea. I
designed it to be taken in another way, but this is easier.

HR-06 - The Round Crossroads
----------------------------
Another of the early creations, easy.

HR-07 - Arachnophobia
---------------------
The first tough map in Hell Revealed, this is an old map by Haggay (edited
by me) which was made more difficult. No need to hide from the spiderdemon,
his aiming is very bad :)

HR-08 - The Jail
----------------
Haggay's earliest map. The bodies can block the way, and if you want to save
ammo, you can crush barons.

HR-09 - Knockout
----------------
This is very tough. There is hardly any ammo, so punching is necessary. My
punching here is ok. The most critical area is the 128 imps fight. (Yes,
there are 128 imps teleporting after you take the yellow key. Don't believe
me? Count them.)

Try to do it in full Tyson style!

HR-10 - Chambers of War
-----------------------
Another early level of Haggay, I like it, especially the outside area with
the hedgemaze. Quite easy.

HR-11 - Underground Base
------------------------
A pretty straight forward map that probably looks harder than it is. There
are plenty of areas with natural shields and the 3 Cyberdemons and the
Spiderboss are not that difficult. The most difficult monsters are probably
the Archviles. My favourite part is the wooden towers with the lifts in the
first Cybie area, beautifully designed. The only tip I can give is to use the
Cyberdemon as an extra weapon in the bfg room..

HR-12 - Great Halls of Fire
---------------------------
This map is the easiest of the maps I recorded and most maps after this are
pure hell. Things can still go wrong, especially in the room with some
Barons/Hellknights and Archviles. There is only one 100% armor and one
soulsphere so conserve your health. I really like the part where (I think
there are 9) some Barons come out from the marble walls one after another
and you only have the time for maximum 4 ssg shots before getting attacked
by the next..

HR-13 - Last Look at Eden
-------------------------
The first real hard map I did from HR. It kept me busy for a long time
until I managed to record it in 56 minutes something. This is about 20
minutes faster than my first lmp. The best way to to finish the first room
is to open the door, avoid the revenants and let the Archvile in, then try
to make the other monsters kill him. The second room is fairly easy if you
not rush it, don´t try to run for the supershotgun, it is no idea without
any armor. Next real hard part is the blue key that is in a cage that will
lock you in for 30 seconds while a bunch of monsters are released. Try to
get the Chaingunners killed first, then the Revenants since they are the
most dangerous in the situation you are in. When the door unlocks and you
still have a fair amount of health left there are no problems. The end is
pretty easy, the Cyberdemon will kill the Archvile and you will kill the
Cyberdemon.

HR-14 - City in the Clouds
--------------------------
Wonderful map to play but oh so hard. It has some very nasty Cyberdemons in
close combat and a vicious yellow key trap. The design is lovely. Some
tips: Make the first Cyberdemon busy by fighting other monsters, on this
lmp he actually gets killed by them, mainly from the Arachnotrons I believe
since they are very effective monster killers. I have only made this map
twice in many tries, so I recommend an easy difficulty setting unless you
are very skilled. Some parts of this lmp aren´t probably exciting to watch
but they are needed for survival. You should really try to create
monsterfights because there are many willing combatants. It has a very hard
jump which takes a near perfect strafe run or a strafe on run to make, plus you
have to stop right away when you have reached the first ledge, it took me
over a minute of trying in this lmp. Fastest way of making this map would
probably be to create some disturbance in the midarea, take the
invulnerability and get the rocketlauncher, jump to the blue key and get an
archvile hit that throws you back on the ground, that will of course mean
that you will face a Cyberdemon without protection in a tiny room. It is
possible but I chose the safer way..

HR-15 - Gates to Hell
---------------------
This is the first lmp of a hard level which I recorded with the mouse, I
switched from keyboard control shortly before it. So forgive me for any bad
playing, aiming, maneuvering and all the other stuff. I let one cyberdemon
kill many of the imps, because killing them myself takes a lot of time and
ammo. I leave through the secret exit.

HR-16 - The Path
----------------
I used to find it very hard, but with the radiation suits it's not too bad.
The amount of rockets I fire in my own face is probably a world record :)

HR-17 - The Black Towers
------------------------
Probably the the third easiest of the episode 2 maps (10-20). The beginning
can be a bit chaotic with only a rocketlauncher against tons of Barons but
I try to get the ssg as soon as possible (I just love that weapon). The
hardest part is probably the blue key house. The Cyberdemons can be tricked
to stay at the door of the start area and can thus be easily dealt with..
The only tip I can come up with is to spare the Sergeant that stands close
to the Spiderboss downstairs in the yellow key area, since he locks the
spider, so first kill the spider and then the soldier..

HR-18 - Hard Attack
-------------------
This map has 143 Revenants! That will tell you a bit about the difficulty.
I have 2 favourite areas, first the megasphere area with some beautiful
effects in the darkness, check it yourself, it is close to the start! Then
the large area with 2 Spiderbosses, beautiful, it is not very easy to get
that far though! The tip is just to try to stay alive ;-). Oh yes, it has a
pretty scary start if standing next to a Cyberdemon is scary.

HR-19 - Everything Dies
-----------------------
Since the only health and ammo are in the start, you might think that
careful playing is necessary. But it's not, this lmp is the proof.

BTW, the end was meant to create an "end of the world" feel, I hope it works
:)

HR-20 - Judgement Day
---------------------
Pretty hard map with some typical Yonatan traps, like an angry Archvile
that appears when you take the rocketlauncher. This map is also made for
creating monsterfights. The Cyberdemons are hard here and it doesn´t feel
safe until the exit area, which has the neccessary space to control the
game. It has a nice invisible bridge just before an Archvile trap.

HR-21 - Siege
-------------
The start is easy, but the end, which is one of my favorite areas ever, is
very hard. If Haggay had put some more cells there, I wouldn't have hidden
so much while fighting the cyberdemons. But as it is, the end is very
boring.

HR-22 - Resistance is Futile
----------------------------
Thanks for a VERY good wad Yonatan, this is extacly the kind of wads I like..
Took me some hours to make this one, once you've learned the level and found a
good route it's a lot easier though.. My first complete 100/100 recording was
at 42 min... However, I thought it was kind of slow so... I made it again..
faster. I think one should save the plasma for the Cyberdemons, mainly because
they can take almost 50 rockets and it's quite dangerous to use rockets only
(sooner or later you make a mistake when using rockets).. Compared to level 32
Plutonia and Punisher.wad I think it has the same
"can't-stop-playing-this-level" feeling.. I don't know if it's harder but it's
still very hard if you don't know extacly what to do.. Personally I think this
is the most enjoyable wad of the ones you've made Yonatan, it's maybe not the
hardest but it's easily the one that is the most fun to play..

HR-23 - Ascending to the Stars
------------------------------
Ascending to the grave would be a better name for me ;-) I have died in
every possible way and place on this map. It is such a hard map but also
one of the most beautifully designed maps I have seen. I have made it twice
in many, many tries (cannot count them all). The only trick is to be agile
and to take a lap in the red key area to snap the key and teleport out of
there again, then some Cyberdemons might get killed by all that autoplasma.
3 very nasty traps are the Chaingunner lift, the lift to the radioactive
room and the lift to the Cyberdemons/pigs room a. Just try to survive.. The
end looks awesome but is not that difficult if you time it right (Open the
door, fire 2/3 rockets and teleport away, repeat).. Goodluck!

HR-24 - Post Mortem
-------------------
Hope I missed no monster, I've checked with IDDT, some Lost Souls out of the
map was all I've seen. Had some luck at the red door, but this way is best :)
Have the Cyberdemon fire at the Mancubus make meanwhile a 2 BFG kill.
Sometimes I killed the teleporting Spiderboss with only one shot, maybe 1 out
of 4. The time improve-ment is caused by the better handling of the Pain
Elementals and the (long lasting) internal fight Archviles vs Cyberdemon on the
bridge. And of course the monster-mix near the exit. I tried to have the
arachnotrons there too, but it was nearly impossible to clean out the red
key area then. I wonder who killed the second Spiderboss there. So, think
it's a nice map, but I'll stop now playing it. Dunno if this time will ever
be improved, since I am still the only player for it ... I hope that
changes. Everything less than 30:00 is really good here.

HR-25 - Dead Progressive
------------------------
Not that I don't care for Revenant missiles anymore, but have a friendly
Cyberdemon at one of the Imp teleport exits. As I checked with iddt I realized
that the second Cyberdemon was very close as I decided to step onto the
Supercharge. It was the first time I released the Cybies to this side, because
they didn't spend many rockets if they were on the other one. I don't know if
something still can be improved here, I doubt it (but maybe Yonatan has got
another idea?). I like the time.

HR-26 - Afterlife
-----------------
Spent the last 3 days for that map, because I knew it isn't that difficult.
But sometimes I can't wait and catch rockets, get ghost in the blue/black rift,
or die with 4 Supercharges left at the 4th teleporter in the green area. Or
simply the last ghosts won't come, because I missed a line. A few times it
happened that I got both backpack and SSG alive, without teleporting to the
chessboard, so I could run for the rifts first. I succeed to take the backpack
in one tenth that safe, I survive another half. It's important to move away
from the door a short time after you've opened it, the Archies would else
immediately attack you and prevent you from taking the backpack. And, at last,
I got a perfect attempt with the ghost at the end, shot rockets like here,
retired, and teleported, hurt myself to 60% health, and did that again and
died. Man, I can't tell you how frustrating that was. I thought of keeping
a Cyberdemon to have some rockets for the ghost if the boxes were not enough,
but there is really a lot of ammo. Okay, NOW I'll never play that map again.

HR-27 - Cyberpunk
-----------------
Haggay's latest level. An easy start if you use the radiation suits, but the
labyrinth can be very hard. I tried several times to kill the cyberdemons
closely and kept dying, this lmp is the result. Tons of hiding and SSG usage
from far range in there, it must be one of the most boring lmps ever. But an
additional megasphere would have really helped me - I told Haggay that, but
he didn't listen :)

HR-28 - Top Hell
----------------
My favorite of Haggay's maps. This underground city looks hard but it isn't,
see how much health I leave behind. I think my way of killing the cybies is
the easiest (and no cells are wasted if it's done right).

HR-29 - Temple of Fear
----------------------
This is probably the easiest of the last 10 maps together with map 25. It
has a very nice design. The start is quite hard though and you need some
luck with the Archviles. The rest is very enjoyable if not that hard.

HR-30 - Hell Revealed
---------------------
I heard people saying this it too tough. But the key here is speed - destroy
the megademon quickly, or you will stand no chance. I let the revenants hit
the cyberdemon so he'll be occupied. 100% kills doesn't mean a lot here, but
I got it anyway.

HR-31 - The Descent
-------------------
Yes, there is a trick to avoid fighting in the lift. But I didn't use it.
This is the way to do this level, fight it out in there. The ammo in the
start is essential if you start from scratch. It's easy to die because
there's no armor, but I wanted it to be hard. I leave through the secret
exit (jumping on the columns isn't easy).

HR-32 - Mostly Harmful
----------------------
This is an extremely tough level, also the one in which I implemented the
most tricks (the bridges you can go both above and under, the arches, the
exit, the HOM-blocker). The most violent level in Hell Revealed. I died a
lot here, but still enjoyed playing it, because there is action all the
time, so many explosions and attacks all around me. Here also 100% kills
doesn't mean much, but here also I got it anyway.

That's it - enjoy the lmps!
