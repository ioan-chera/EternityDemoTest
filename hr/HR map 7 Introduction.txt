This map is quite hard if you are not good at killing arachnotrons, you may easily get killed at the very start.

When killing them, not only you need to use the Circle-strafing strategy, you also need to be careful of the 
arachnotrons coming from the other sides. If you just led them all into a horde, then everything will be easy.
And just enough ammo to finish off all arachnotrons too, so lucky!

That stupid Spider Mastermind at the end is just a dumbass. I doesn't need to hide at all and then it was killed
randomly. I think no one should have any problem killing it.

I was happy to get below 6 minutes and beat Megasonic's (Nevan) of 6:18 record.

If you look at the automap, you may found that this map is just a spider!!!
