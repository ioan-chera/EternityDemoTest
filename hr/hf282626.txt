I didn't expect to get this on my first try, so it isn't very optimized
even for me.
I must say, a ghost-mancubus is pretty rare.  surprised me.  =)

I make all sorts of first-time mistakes -- like not activating the 5 cybs at the same time, wasting cells on the archviles, almost dying in the Spidermastermind room, etc...

twice as slow as my max and pathetic next to the other -fast times; but any HR -fast recording is cool if you ask me.
