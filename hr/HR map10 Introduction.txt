A fun map in a huanted house, the beginning is a headache for me to kill those demons with the chainsaw, I got 
several times bitten, it hurts. 

By the time I kill those 2 barons, I hope to be fast so that I can kill that pain elemental behind, but I got
a careless drop when killing the last baron.

The maze is just very small, I can find the blue key easily. The rest is ok lol.
