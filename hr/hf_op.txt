Most of these are not optimized at all.  Many of them were acheived on my first attempt.
Once I got it, I moved to the next map.
Forget Map09.  I don't think I can even do that without -fast.
Even though the demo for Map07 doesn't look so great, it is easily the hardest of the bunch -- the rest are academic.
