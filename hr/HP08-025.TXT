  Hell Revealed - MAP08 - The Jail

Was just testing a new mousepad, really, and happened to hit a 2
sec improvement on my recent 0:27 on my second try! Extremely lucky
with the lost souls, here, this is about as fast as you can get past
them. This is a 25.09, with slightly better running could have been
a 0:24 :(

Run with genuine DOOM2.EXE in dosbox on Linux.
