Description:

I fully agree with Peo Sjoblom that it's the most original and beautiful map
ever, and the hardest one in Hell Revealed (when playing from scratch, without
using the shortcut). Pity that the exit jump makes it too easy for NM Speed,
but in the NM100S category it's an interesting challenge. Rushing through the
mysterious blue dimension is really fun, though irritating due to colossal speed
of health's descending. In most attempts I was owned by the cyber, and I also
failed the final jump many times, but through these hundreds of screwups I
learned to execute the run more quickly and smoothly. So I got a good time
(only aimed for something under 50) without too much effort, on the first exit.
And some colorful fireworks accompanied my rise to the stargate :-)
