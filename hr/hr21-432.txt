Watched Opulent's demo in the huge collection he uploaded recently and thought the infights could be done all at once instead
of waiting until everything is dead to release the cacos, looks like this way it's possible to get sub4 if you get a better 
cyber-pinky infight, ideally 3 cybers get biten to death and the mastermind dies to imps, in this demo it takes me ~20 secs
to ssg the spider that should be straight time saved if it gets killed by imps earlier. All of these infights depends 100% on
luck, the mastermind rarelly dies, usually only one cyber dies to pinkies and the route isn't easy at all, so get the ideal
infighting would be quite a grind.
