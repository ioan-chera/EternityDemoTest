Demo entry #23.

Description:

Recorded this to have some easy fun after HN16. I only wanted something below
2:20 (because Cameron Prosser's TAS Pacifist time is 2:26).

Took just a few minutes. A typical unpolished first-exit run, but I like the
crazy ending of this demo. With flawless running and brilliant luck, it's doable
in 1:5X without the trick glides :-)
