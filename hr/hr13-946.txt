Description: 

12years ago in 1998 I was apart of a team making a demopack for this megawad. 
I spend hours playing this map, over and over again. After a week of playing I made exits around the 17-18min mark. I dunno if it ever made me a better player but I had to give it up finaly. Peo Sjoblom made it to about 15min, which was fantastic given the standards back then. When coming back for this one to get revenege I couldn't belive I would spend time even loading it into doom. 
I had to finish it for old times sake and make piece with it. First exit below 10mins. 

Here is a list of my complains in no particular order:

# Totaly in lack of any gameplay mechanics
# Horrible design all over the place. 
# Weapon balance in general, no BFG?, 25rockets in total?
# Monster placements, placing two barons in their own respective towers? just   because its so fun having to chop down a gazillion hitpoints with cg or use 8   out of 25rockets on them? 
# Gohost issues, how likely is it that a revenant is gonna be crushed under the   bluedoor? No rockets to kill ghosts with ? 
# Too many luck based sitations all over. 

As for this demo itself it's a first time exit under the 10min mark really. 
Too much luck involved all over for this to ever be any fun. With some exceptional luck you can probably get this on at around 8min or something, even late 7 I guess but who cares :) I could never play this one for more than 1hour at the time, you just get tired. 

As for previous demo submissions beeing done, I do not recognize them unless they are played under doom2 v1.9. There is no reason as to why a d2 1.9 compatible .wad should be played under diffrent circumstances. DosBox emulators gives no problem loading\running d2 1.9.exe anymore.
