Time:      

hr19-311 -- ack.  stupid mistakes. fun run.
hr21-914 -- while making my maxrecord on here.  :)
hr271050 -- a very long way from 6:36.



hf19-452 -- slow, but successful. plasma at spectres is required.
            annoyingly, your shots don't always shoot at what you
	    are aiming at...
hf211022 //
hf211033 -- unpracticed... not far from Alexander's record time.
 	    I'm sure someone has a unreleased record on here.

my latest HR collection.
really just improved times over my "if I made it, I kept it" demos.

decided to just release this since I don't have time to work on it anymore.
