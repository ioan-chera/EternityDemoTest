  [Compet-N entry #117]

  Isn´t some category UV Max -fast +safe ?? :P
  Xit´s hf07-522 was really easy for beat and I´m sure this run
  isn´t different.
  I did it on first exit, this run is really easy when you (or I, so marine)
  going after first circle for shells (isn´t so important with little luck)
  and 20% of health. So I must write same thing as Xit before me - easy half
  of point.
