Description:

When you die 10 times in a row and never even make it to the first door,
you know it's a hard level....

I had the idea to play this level about a year ago, but wasn't a good enough
DOOM player to beat it. :-)  Still, it took me about three days of doing
NOTHING else when I finally sat down to do it.  In the process I wound up
with about a dozen situations of "start over if..." (grabbing the green armor
too soon, releasing both cyberdemons at once, etc.)  And in this lmp, just
about everything goes wrong that could possibly go wrong without actually
dying.

I had to leave one (ghost) cacodemon alive at the end, she got stuck on the
edge of the map and wouldn't come close enough to a wall for me to frag 'er;
as a result I missed beating Peo's time by 2 seconds...
