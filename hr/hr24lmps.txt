Description:

Post Mortem is among my favorite levels. 

I've never got under 18 mins with Angew's route. Here, I let cybies and mancubi do anything what they want. Guess, using this route, some players will manage to cut down the time under 10 mins. But the route is heavily depended on cybies-mancubi score. I've want to put this one under 13 mins. But I'll believe I beat it next time.

Special thanks Yonathan Donner, all players that recorded demos for this map before me and Eternity team for outstanding engine. I've extensively used walkcam feature to learn the most beneficial infights. 

The demo is dedicated all doomers that were constantly killed wading HR (me was killing too) and still like HR.
