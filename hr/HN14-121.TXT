Demo entry #101.

Description:

Another one of my old results bites the dust. One of my (many) beloved Hell
Revealed levels, so I decided to give it a try for the third time (after 1:51 in
2007 and 1:37 in 2010). No new tricks here, just much better general running
(and also good fortune with the yellow key vile).

NM100S would be an interesting challenge.
