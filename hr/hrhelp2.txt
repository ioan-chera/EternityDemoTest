Comments:

This is a Hell Revealed -nomonsters with 100% secrets demopack.

There are not optimal, but they are all at least 1 second faster
than the one done by the HR crew.

These will show you the quickest routes to all the secrets in a map.
Remember, these times are not optimal, but they are faster than the
set released by the HR crew.

Also, because map 7 is impossible to complete on -nomonsters, I have
included a skill 1 demo in it's place.

I hope you enjoy these demos. ^_^
