Description:

The atmosphere of this minimalistic location is just fantastic. An elegant and
surreal combination of HR's starry sky and cleverly chosen wall/floor textures.

MAP22 is more violent than the previous HR levels, but not more difficult.
There's very much cover and firepower, so none of the assault waves are
particularly hard to avoid. When I first played Hell Revealed on UV in 2004,
MAP13 was a severe barrier for me to pass, but MAP22 was relaxing (unlike 23,
which is a true step up in HR's difficulty). As one of the WAD reviewers said,
22 is "the easiest of HR's hard levels, or the hardest of HR's easy levels".

Many years ago I downloaded the pack of HR TAS maxes, and Esko's HR22-540 was
the most impressive one for me to watch. It's full of crazy cyber-blasting, but
still, with a higher degree of aggression it's heavily improvable. My route
provides astronomical amounts of instant death risks, but releasing all the
major hordes on the first 2 minutes hugely increases the power of infights.
First survival :)
