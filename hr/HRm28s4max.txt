This time I wanted to fight cyberdemons with BFG 9000 and this was
the perfect map to do that, certainly this map is really easy and I only
wanted to upload this to DSDA for the pleasure to show you some
dangerous situations where I could've died and it didn't happen.
Obviously this is not a good time and I feel capable to beat this time for
about 4 minutes (with a efficient route and killing all cybers with two
shots of BFG), and since I missed a fuckin mancubus at the end
I have to improve this and upload a worthy demo for this map soon
BTW, I almost never check my demos out to find misses, and this was
the second time I do it... I repent to have done that!, thanks to that
I realized I miss a monster and I really took great care at finding it
but this was futile, when I played-back demo to check out what was
that damned hellspawn I missed before with IDDT/automap cheat
I noted that it always was in front of me, I feel ashamed about it anyway
Since I only can play Doom at weekends my improved demo in this map
has to wait.
