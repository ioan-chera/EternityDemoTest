Heh, it took about 20 minutes to get this on the lucky Friday. ;)

Anyway this run looks a bit ugly in some places, but it's 42, so I can't
complain. Even though I got it in a short amount of time, I'm getting fed
up with this map because of the stupid curved hall after the teleporter.
It's so difficult to run in there quickly, which I achieved only 3 times in
about 20 minutes. This is that 3rd time, so you can see after that I bump
into a couple of walls; however it's not overall bad.

Either way I'm sure Looper or Cacatou or someone can come along and probably
beat this within 10 minutes, maybe even break 40, who knows?
