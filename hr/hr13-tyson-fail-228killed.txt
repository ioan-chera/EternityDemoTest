
Hell Revealed map 13, tyson attempt.

I killed 228/266 monsters in 82 minutes.

Disregarding a bunch of quick deaths in the first room, this was my second attempt. Almost finished it! I had not practiced the ending at all, so I totally panicked and died. I was also unaware of the blue armor secret as I have not played HR that much. What a blunder.

So, considering my inexperienced stupidity, this is totally possible. I would even say this is easy. You just need patience, nothing else. Rushing is bad, real bad. At the end, I rushed in panic. Damn, Doom. Damn...
