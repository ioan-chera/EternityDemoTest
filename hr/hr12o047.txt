Quite a fun map from first HR; I rather like it. I agree with SAV that it's
a real fun one to run, but of course he means it differently since he ran
it on Nightmare and I did it without monsters. :P

I got a few 48's and a couple 49's before this, but this is by no means
perfect. With basically no competition, I'm really just going until I feel
like stopping here, heh. However, I doubt that if somebody gets 46, I
could get 45.
