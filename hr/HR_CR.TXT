Just a few assorted HR demos I did at various times in the last few months.
All done for fun.

HR07-543: Not too hard.
HR112000: Why couldn't it be one second faster ...?
HR171747: My attempt at Chozoron's route - you probably don't need to
          watch this one :)
HR263232: Fastest max on this level by 37 seconds, but the ghosts didn't
          appear so this isn't COMPET-N uploadable (?). I might change my
          mind on this level, it's not so hard now. (One hour's work).
          HR24 is harder...
HR28-842: Recorded when Anders' 8:XX was the record. Obviously it's slower
          now...
HF112945: New record by 6 minutes or so.
HF143307: I like this one for a few reasons:
          - first try :)
          - a very funny scene as the first Cybie gets a little too close
            for comfort...
          - I forgot about going back to the cacos, but Cybie was kind enough
            to kill them all for me...
HF211257: Alexander's route makes this level easy and fun.
HF221831: Another fun one once you survive that bastard start...
