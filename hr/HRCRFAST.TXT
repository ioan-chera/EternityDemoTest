Hmm, well this collection sort of came together at random. Some of these
demos have appeared at the DSDA, some at COMPET-N. Some are all new! Can't
remember which though. In any case, this represents every -fast HR level
that has been done. Maybe I can give this PWAD a rest for now...

Map01: Easy easy map. I've done it faster for COMPET-N since, though.
       I was going to include that demo, but I couldn't find it on my HD...
Map02: Complete timewaster. You have better things to do than watch this.
       Record should be easy to get.
Map03: Early demo. Improved this one for COMPET-N too, if they've
       finally updated you can get it there...
Map04: Really really annoying map. Have to cover shots from all angles
       with little room to move.
Map05: The slow, easy route. Don't remember a thing about this one.
Map06: Never really liked this level. Demo is okay.
Map07: Played the wimp route, not that you have much choice here. As
       boring as they come. This is actually the record by 6 seconds,
       but there's no way this shit is compet-n standard...
Map08: Not bad. Anders has an unbelievable record here. Tough map.
Map09: Ultra-tough start, harder than UV. But, just like UV, make
       it to the megasphere and you're just about home.
Map10: Messy.
Map11: This is the current record. The start can be tricky. The rest is
       as exciting as watching wet cheese go moldy.
Map12: Anders' route, I think. If you're fast enough the Barons won't
       wander. Stupid me forgot to wake up the cacos, and later on
       Spider got me pretty good :)
Map13: Not at all easy. Start is hard, and I'm so unfamiliar with the
       later territory that I get tentative. But still a current record.
Map14: First try- bit of a fluke, this one. Cybie was so helpful, killing
       all those cacos and somehow missing me :)
Map15: Living on the knife edge. A few mistakes, a few strange things...
Map16: Infighting really helps on this level. Cause there's not quite
       enough rockets. Old demo.
Map17: I don't know how Peo managed to get the SSG straight off in his
       run. Every time I tried it the mancubuses gave me a fiery death...
       Rocket launcher is just as useful though :)
Map18: The longer demo was my first successful run through the level.
       The second just me pissing around.
Map19: The 5:32 is crap, except for a nice Cyber kill. The 4:06 is
       okay, would be hard for me to push it further - plus it equals
       another recording on this level :)
Map20: I like this one. Everything went according to plan :)
Map21: Took a rocket near the end, but everything else was cool. This is
       definitely the way to play this level.
Map22: Killer start - I almost always die. After that, you get to do
       one of two things: a) kills lots of enemies from a distance
       with the rocket launcher; b) BFG a few Cybers. Nice how the spiders
       get the attention of all the cybers so I can dispose of them
       as a group...
Map24: AFAIK, this is the first ever -fast recording of this level. Not
       so hard when you know what to do. I knew I needed to get somewhere
       safe early on - the Archvile ledge looked right for this. And the
       invuln helps survive the first thirty insane seconds, as well
       as getting the BFG. From then on it's just mopping up. Things would
       go faster if you could get the blue key when invulnernable, but I
       rarely managed this. Greater infighting means you'll be swamped in
       ammo by the end.
Map25: I'm no good at this level, but I love it.
Map27: * The first Cybie is easy if you handle him right.
       * I wimped out in the maze big time. Memo to self - BFG is not
         an effective long-range weapon :)
       * The ending! Freakin' Cyber wouldn't come out! Cross your fingers,
         because I certainly was :)
Map28: Ehh...
Map29: Another Killer Start. Rest of the level is very pretty.
Map31: Wimp route in the lift, the rest went well. Actually made the secret
       exit... the wonders of strafe50 :)
Map32: Heheh... damn you Anders :) I would have had this collection done
       two weeks ago if it hadn't been for this level.
       This was HELL to get. But I just sat down ten minutes ago, started
       playing... and this came out. Things got hairy at the end... Don't
       know if I killed all the Hel Knights, and frankly don't care - no way
       am I going to do this again...
