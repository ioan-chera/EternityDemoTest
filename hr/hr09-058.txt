Comments:  This death slide is hard in vanilla doom.
           Your corpse cannot slide under monsters =(
           Using imps is of course possible but hard,
           you need to be killed while moving with decent speed to the teleport.
           Previous records use revenants as they can push you corpse.
           This run uses slide with av assistance.
           Good timing is a must for this trick: at the moment of the av attack
           you need not only the right momentum but also
           the right position to not bump into the upper bars.
