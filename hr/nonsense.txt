some 6 months ago - needless to say that with some true grit times could be
cut in half :P

[btw, if you notice some mad turning nonsense, blame my lousy (now defunct) mouse driver...]

a few words about them (yes, I'm bored):

well, in general I like a good tyson challenge, but this map has two flaws

a) it's way too easy (took me three tries, the first time I forgot to use -maxdemo, 
the second time I forgot the red key :)
b) it's also pretty boring, punching through a horde of imps and pigs aint my 
definition of fun.. though it's still OK if you have nothing better to do at 3 AM ;)

full route credits to Peo btw

IIRC this was my first try reaching the exit with 100% kills, pretty easy to leave an
imp behind..

for all who care, this beats the time in hruvlmp2 by some margin, but that's no big task
since it was Peo's first HR -fast demo, aside from that some of his -fast in that demoset 
are pretty dire, sorry to say. Some others are quite amazing though, at least for 
their time (hr13 -fast comes to mind..) 

obviously 2:xx should be more like it, and no, even if you have a HR rec, Budweiser wont 
let you do one of their beer commercials (don't ask)

one last thing: the UV time in hruvlmp2 was 3:01, no idea why the txt says 3:25 - and 
actually it wasn't recorded by Yonatan ;)

umn.. my third try I think it was (back in novemeber that is)

afaik, this is the *cough*first*cough* demo of top hell on skill 5,
tho I'm not 100% it's mine, it might have been recorded by either
my daughter or my mother-in-law (3 and 56 years respectively)

well if HR09 is a berzerk map, this is a SSG map :P

I just watched Esko's lmp from the second demoset, sat down and got this in less than 
20 minutes, the layout is a bit confusing at the end, but the gameplay is OK. 
IMHO trying to optimize this map is like a broken pencil: pointless..
