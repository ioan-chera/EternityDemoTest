Pwad:      Hell Revealed by Yonatan Donner and Haggay Niv
Pwad name: hr.wad
Maps:      1-32
Skill:     1 (I'm too young to die)
Category:  Max 
Exe:       Doom2.exe

As with all of my demos since 1995:
Completely vanilla setup with doom/doom2.exe, no cheats, source-ports(with the exception of a scant few MBF/Boom demos), or crutches.
native OS calls, no autorun, no mixed key binds, TSRs, or config cheats
This is the real game.



These are mostly first attempts, so don't expect them to be optimized.
On skill1, there are occasionally different challenges in the maps.
