Demo entry #112.

Description:

A gorgeously designed map, just like the following HR levels. The architecture
reminders me a bit of "Schlosspark Rheinsberg", which is just a few hundreds of
meters away from my home :-)

It's the first truly HRish map in terms difficulty, and playing it on NM felt
like "doing the impossible" back in 2007. But now it's just a normal challenge
for me, though surviving all these raBid-fire flows in a single attempt is
unthinkable without utilizing gigantic luck. The principle "SAV must die!" is
almost a physical law here.

In my old demo I approached the central yard in a semi-confused way, but now I
put my trajectory into science (except for hesitating a bit in the blue key
cage), hence such a huge improvement.
