Description:

The biggest HR level in geometrical size. Superb grand design, with a grim, wild
and oppressive feel. 

It's a much harder nightmare challenge than 14, but not as tough as HN13. Of
course you need hellloads of luck to survive all those enormous flows of
rabid-fire, but thankfully there are no hitscanners, except for one lousy
Spider Mastermind :-)

The battle near the final lift is the climax of the run, I died about 20 times
there. I'm glad to finally survive it, even though it could be handled many
seconds faster with more luck.

Once I had extreme excess of health before the red key, but 169/170 instantly
turned into 0/0 due to loathsome monster behavior (shown in HN16DAMN.LMP). But
now I don't care for that damn attempt, because it was slower than my eventual
run :-)
