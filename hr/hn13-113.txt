Description:

The first non-warm-up level in Hell Revealed. And it's the 3rd time I finished
this crazy adventure on NM. 12 years ago I recorded my initial 2:23 tablefiller.
In 2012 (when I was already capable of playing much speedier than in 2007-2010)
I reran the map, pulling off an even faster time than I wanted. Still, 1:21
looked a bit slow for my current standards. Now I take the yellow card and the
blue skull much more aggressively, but also make more detours (because of not
having such huge loads of luck with health/armor conservation as in the 1:21
demo, except for the start).

This took 2215 attempts.
