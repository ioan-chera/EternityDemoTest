euh?! no wait, wrong txt - hold on a mo'

"piece of shit demo for a piece of shit map" :P

on a side note: I got slightly confused halfway thru, but that freak of a security-man
wanted to close the comp-room 10 min earlier than usual! (sheck the timestamp)
on the other side I think I only reached the exit once before in 25 mins of play, so
maybe his intrusion helped me focus on the game..? still screw'd up the end tho (using
BFG instead of RL on that rev, loosing at least 10 secs, etc)
...

WHATEVER!!

2.xx is easy peasy lemon squeezy - at least if you know how to shake a mouse ;)
2.35 or 2.25 would be nice here (on both -fast & regular UV)
