

this three demos are the result of 15-30min efforts, ie. sloppy and not worth the
watching time..

I recorded them at a University terminal, just wanted to mention that this makes for: 

-a big flat glare on the monitor
-lousy headphones
-bad mouse_sense
-uncomfortable chair
-cheap aircondition, small desk.. oh well enough whining..

hf29: lots of crappy mistakes, but I can't be bothered to redo it;
      anyway, once you exit the secret black maze (IDDT) you should bring 
      the run home.. if you wonder why I wait for the last archies to teleport 
      in, you don't know where they lurk :P

hf22: as a former recorder of this map said, if you get past the first seconds you 
      shouldn't die (at least not at this pace;), since if the 6 megas aren't enough 
      you can always go hide behind a corner or use safe distances.. I still like
      Esko's original recording

hf10: gawd, this map's a mess (just try it) - Anders deserves a mentioning
      for the PE/plasma trick :)
