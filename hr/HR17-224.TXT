Description:

Extremely great map for the 17th stage of HR's progression. Terrific visuals,
truly HRish structures and color combination. Also, this music track is my
favorite in the megawad (together with the one on MAP11) -- it fits the
atmosphere of Hell Revealed extraordinarily well.

This level is really crowded (with a total monster health over 100000%), and 
unfriendly for speedrunning, but still a fun challenge. Cameron Prosser's TAS
pacifist time is 1:04, and his run is still imperfect, but I can't follow his
route in a real demo -- there is practically no chance of surviving the blue
key building at his speed in a single attempt, for me at least. I also suck at
glides, and almost can't perform this particular red key grab, so here is a run
without any shortcut tricks :-) It's also done using only the rocket launcher.
First exit.
