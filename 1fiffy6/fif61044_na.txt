 I had been following with amusement TGH's foray into the world of 
 Fiffy WADs and was dismayed to find out that he's been slacking off
 for the past year. Too bad, the next installment turned out to be
 quite fun.
 In his 1fiffy6_mn MaxMaikl spent nearly 25 minutes here, god knows
 why (and Allah is all-knowing! ;)*. Either he didn't think the rocket
 launcher could have been obtained _much_ earlier or he simply enjoyed
 the grind. Well, whatever the case, this one should be a lot more
 watchable.

 Here's to Selyodka's Fiffy passion rekindling in 2011. :P
