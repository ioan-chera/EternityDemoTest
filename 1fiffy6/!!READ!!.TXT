NEED HELP? PLEASE tell me WHICH REoL TOUGH level you need help in! I have
TEN at the moment, and I may confuse one with the other! If you have AOL,
read about the  REoL TOUGH DOOM LEVEL HELPLINE above.

PLEASE SEND APROPRIATE MAIL TO THE APROPRIATE PERSON(S)! HOWEVER, if you
have SOFTWARE CREATIONS BBS access, but you have no AOL or INTERNET 
access, I will relay your questions about the music, documentation, or  
the actual level construction, and of course, a week after distribuiton,
help on these levels.

***** CURIOCITY CHECK *****  I upload my levels on America On-Line (AOL),
                             Software Creations BBS, and Real Time BBS.
                             These levels spread. I'm always curious as
                             to where they end up!

IMPORTANT!: DOOM III: Quayle is President! <-- Pray this doesn't happen.

PS: If you have any suggestions for the next REoL TOUGH levels, contact me!
   I can't change the graphics (SOB!), and someone else does the music
   (NO RAP, dance , hip-hop , or R&B please. It doesn't fit in DOOM).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This game can be played in all modes. In 1 or multi-player games, you'll
start out in a room with cages holding Barrons. To "escape", hit the switch
in front of you. The bad thing about this level is all those barrons!
  In Deathmatch, you are in separate rooms, but mostly close to each other.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO PLAY THE NEW LEVEL

At the DOOM prompt, type:          DOOM -FILE FIFFY6.WAD

  You can choose the level of difficulty you want. Any way you set it, it's
  going to be an uphill battle big time!

        CPU REQUIREMENTS: You will need a 486 pc of at least 20MHz for
                          flawless scrooling (mostly). A 386 of 33MHz or
                          faster will also do a great job!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 STORY:

        It was a nice, sunny day on the moon of Phobos. You decide to
take a nature walk around the terrain, when you come across a weird (yet
interesting) structure about two miles away. Since you walk the same route
practically every day, you swore that that building was not there before.
You decide to trailblaze (in the treeless plains, don't get lost!) towards
this structure.
        You are almost there. You decide to stop for a moment and look at
the building, stretching across the hill it was sitting on, and you say
to yourself: "That sucker is HUGE!"
        You walk closer towards the structure, and you can finally see
some detail on the structure. "Something just does not seem right" you say
to yourself. You get an eerie feeling in your stomach, but after puking
you brains out on that bottled Mexican water you drank an hour ago, you
still press onwards, towards the ominous superstructure.
        You are getting very close now. You can read a sign up ahead.
About 1/4 mile from the building, the sign reads "Enter at your own risk".
You heard noises coming from the structure, but as you step onto a dry
twig, all the noise in that direction came to a halt. You must have fig-
ured that it was the U.S. Government still trying to hide some top secret
space craft like some morons in the desert who think you do not know what
they are hiding. You decide to start running towards the superstructure,
and you are very close. Suddenly, something weird happens.
        A green puff of smoke appears all around you, accompanied by a
metallic sound. Once the noise and green smog around you diminished, you
realized you were teleported INSIDE the secret structure, and now you are
inside the "forbidden teritory" of Hell's new tenement for all the bad
boys from Hell, The Barrons, the Cacodaemons, and, well, more Barrons!
Too many Barrons! Of course, a few weaklings are here as well (how did
they get to work in here?). 
        Well, it looks like you have yet another tough mission ahead of
you. All I can say is, GO GET 'EM!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              PLAYING TIPS:

(1) GRAB THAT SHOTGUN! You can't survive without at least a shotgun!

(2) This game has a few "puzzles" to solve. This may require you to search
    the entire level (depending on where you go) to find certain doors
    and switches. Some doors require switches to open them. ALWAYS look
    around when searching for switches! Some are nearly impossible to find
    because they are in a dark room, so look carefully for them!

(3) When you release Barrons, try to get them in one of the bigger rooms,
    or on a long (and at least a semi-wide) bridge, or walkway. There is
    one semi-big room you'll find full of ammo, but I don't think you
    want to fight in there.

(4) Beam me up Scotty!

(5) SECRETS ARE SECRET: As usual, with the exception of the ones in plain
    sight (since REoL TOUGH: The Pit), the remainder of the secrets are
    not visible on the map, even with the all-map cheat code! It just goes
    to show you that cheating is not fair!
    ONE IS EXTREMELY HUGE!

(6) CAGES: There are Cacodaemons waiting for you behind the cages (as well
    as a few Barrons in others). Try to find WHERE to stand and shoot them
    to kingdom come!

(7) The room with many crates in it holds suprises galore!

(8) WIN $2,000,000 CASH! Just write to Pan Am's new sweepstakes offer!

(9) The best place to fight Barrons? How about OUTSIDE? Some will be out
    there, but once those are dead, you can lead the others outside (if
    you only want to wait forever for them to follow you).

(10) Speaking of fighting outside, keep an eye out behind you OFTEN, since
     Barron(s) love to sneak up from behind!

(11) It's best to shoot Barrons on the balconies from far away (but not
     too far). Some of them again, can be lured outside.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known "Boo-boo's":

(1) TRAPPED ON STAIRWELL: The stairwell in front of you, when you start,
    has an odd, turning fashion to it, so enemies like Barrons get stuck
    at ceartain points. WHAT AN ADVANTAGE!
