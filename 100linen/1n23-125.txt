Comments: Pretty half-assed effort and shoudn't be too hard to beat. Maxing this map isn't
	  very exciting so I didn't bother putting much time into this. Still, the infights
	  happened pretty smoothly and the only bigger flaw is that one HK not joining the
	  initial massacre. And obviously the start is pretty damn slow compared to my 
	  pacifist demo.
