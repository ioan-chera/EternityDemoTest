Comments:  To reach 14s i need four lucky events in a row:
           1. Quickly pass first pinky.
           2. Don't get blocked at the beginning of the second field.
           3. AV must not be distracted by loads of projectiles and chaingunners, and let make a good jump.
           4. Don't get blocked after jump.
           Success chances of each part are low, especially no.3!.
           I made it after ~300 attempts.
