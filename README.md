# EternityDemoTest
Eternity demo regression testing set

This is a set of demos to test Eternity with. The list will grow as I need more demos to test.

Important: you need Eternity from github.com/team-eternity/Eternity, compiled from the demo-test branch (not master!).

How to use: create a folder in your local copy, named "eternity-port". Inside it, place a link (or a copy) of the demo-test compiled Eternity executable and the user/ and base/ folders. Check the testdemos.sh.in and testdemos.bat.in files to see exactly where Eternity should be install, and feel free to modify them if you need another location.

Caution when git-cloning: this may be a pretty big git repository.
