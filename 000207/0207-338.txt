Comments:  Heheh, this innocent little level really annoyed me because I tried to play it in a very risky way and of course kept dying and dying. ^_^ Why do I kill the cacos near the exit in this strange way? Well, I tried killing them from the bridge but they didn't want to fly up, so it was hard to aim at them and I always ran out of ammo.
