I used to think I wouldn't be the one to do this demo, but as fate had it, I did. The start is a bit tricky, but after that, it's pretty easy. One major screw-up was in the blue key area where my health goes down to 6% due to the pain elemental shooting all these lost souls so quickly. The demon trying to bite me didn't help either. Because of this, I end up being a bit cautious until when I face the spiderdemon because I had already saved 3 medikits so I could already tell I beat it.
