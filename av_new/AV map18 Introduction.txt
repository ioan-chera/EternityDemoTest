This map is hard, but it's very fun, there's lot of rockets and BFG spams!!!

I am not good at dealing with traps, so it's good for me to deal it easily in this run. I like the imp sewers, it
seems that place is hard. But no, it's just easy. All you have to do is to spam BFG on them! Other from this, I am
OK with the other parts in that area.

I like the open Spider hall very much, that's the main battleground of this map, and it's great fun in that area!
I was in a great time, it's so fun!!! 

After that main battleground, the remaining works are just easy. After the mancubus hordes, I just spam plasma
gun with the zombies, and after all, it's done!

This is one of my favourite map in AV, I do like rockets and BFG spams! Since this map is quite hard, I set my 
target below 18 minutes. Maybe time done is slow, but I am satisfied.
