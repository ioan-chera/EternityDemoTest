Description:

Credits to Tatsurd for a great hardworked improvement over my wimpy, extra-old
0:49, and also for an interesting textfile which detailedly explains the
difficulties of this run. Like him, I didn't aim to execute the AV jump on the
first try, because of extremely low success rate. Doing it on vile's second or
third attack is relatively easy (this way my success rate is 3-5%) and allows
me to pick up 40 extra health. So I did the speedrunning trick the "slow" way
(like Tatsurd did in his second-best run, 0:44), compensating it by clean aiming
in the start. And the main improvement comes from rushing the last part without
BFG. It's dangerous, but can be handled with running at the right trajectory,
shooting at the right moments, and luck.

Here's my first exit, gotten in only 5 hours. Time isn't that great, but I like
the look of the demo (except from getting stuck before the end, just like in my
old AN23-049).

I also include a failed run which could be 0:35 with right luck in the end,
AN23SCRW.LMP.
