Comments: Hats off to Anders and Xit. Those posted record times were super fast and i thought untouchable. 
This is a particularly fun map to run because one can go super agro with all the med kits. 
This started off as challenge for myself to see if i could crack 5:00 which was a barrier that is actually
very hard to beat. Eventually i was consistently hovering around the 4:30 mark before i pulled off this gem :-)

I used a slightly different route that may or may not be faster. Picking up the Blue armor after exiting the red key room
allowed me to play more aggressive in the 2nd half of the map. I provoked infighting between the chaingunners in the red key trap then took
them out with the chaingun. This saved valuable cells that were otherwised wasted in the air. Then i tried to draw out the barons in the 
RL room and blow them up with a few rockets in the heard of Imps later. This doesnt always work because the barons sometimes get jammed up 
in the door. Sometimes they dont line up like in this demo. I wasted a few rockets here. Everything else went smoothly.

I included a heartbreaking 4:19 cleaner demo that ends in me losing a second and the record by smashing my face into the exit switch 
instead of activating it.
