READ THE P.S.!!!

I got this in about half an hour, not because 41 is too hard to get, but
just because I only had 3 good RJ's in that time. Yeah, it can get quite
annoying when you keep failing it. The other two demos I had I exited with
42.34 and 42.06. Just when I was about ready to stop recording for a while,
I finally got this.

While I think it's pretty good, I know under 40 is possible without all
my bad and ugly mistakes. These bad and ugly mistakes occur due to the
nature of the level, with winding, low-ceiling corridors, and also partly
to my stupid playing. :)

P.S. I've tried RJ'ing without armor and just straight SR50 jumping over
the barriers, but when recording without tools, it seems that you need to
grab both the armor and RL and perform the RJ to stay alive and get over
the barriers. In AV MAP20, however, I discovered that it's possible to
SR50 jump over the gap that you'd RJ over. It would save a couple of 
seconds because you don't need to grab RL and soulsphere. Since I can't
seem to beat Cacatou's MAP20 run, I've included the demo showing the
jump trick here. If you want to skip my crappy running at the beginning of 
that one, the SR50 jump occurs sometime after 30 seconds into the demo. I
also posted that trick demo on doomworld in the misc demos 2 thread.
