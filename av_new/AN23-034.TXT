Demo entry #78.

Description:

Once again, Tatsurd pushed this run to a new degree of aggressiveness. His 0:36
is a truly solid, truly Compet-N-style record. Fortunately I found a reliable
way to speed up the start even more (rushing past the demon and imps pacifist
style). It allows to reach the door in just 4 seconds. So from the eight NM
speed demos here (1:21, 1:03, 0:59, 0:49, 0:42, 0:39, 0:36, 0:34) each next one
has a faster beginning than the previous one :-)

Now the demo turned out as I wanted, and I'm glad that the random number
generator allowed me to get a 0:34 run in 3 pathetic hours instead of wasting 30
hours for pulling out 0:35. Two angry demons brought some chaos into my run,
but due to great luck I managed to pass them unnaturally smoothly.
