After trying for a while (and failing) to beat Cacatou's time for MAP13,
I decided to come to this map for something new since his 2:04 was a low
one (not many hundredths of a second). Well, I matched 2:04 on my second
try not having even familiarized myself with the map well. Definitely
MAP14 was one of the weaker runs in his pack, if not the weakest. It took
me only about 20 minutes to improve it 4 seconds. Still, this demo is a
bit sloppy, so a time sub 2 minutes is possible. I don't want to do it now,
however.
