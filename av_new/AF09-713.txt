  Description :)
  One of my favorite AV maps, Kim André Malde did a great job. Love the
  music too, it adds such a great atmosphere to the spooky level. Shame
  such a talented mapper had to die so young.
  
  Anyways, this was pretty hard, as -FAST always is, but could still be
  improved upon with little effort. Under seven will be easy, under six
  -- not so much.
