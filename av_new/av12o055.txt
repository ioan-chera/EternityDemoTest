Not as tricky and more fun than I expected. Win-win!

Now that my 1monster demopack is finished, I'm going back and trying to
get my nomonsters records back for AV.

It took me ~ 15 minutes to get this, so the demo isn't really "pretty," just
a general demo with a couple small wallbumps. With better running alone and
SR40 only like this demo, probably 54 is optimal. With SR50, who knows how
low the time could get?

P.S. this demo is only 7 tics faster than Cacatou's demo. I'm surprised
he left such a low 56.
