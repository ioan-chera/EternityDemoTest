This is my favourite map in Alien Vendetta. I like the beautiful design techbase and the music "The demons from
Adrian's pen", which suits very well in this map.

To me, this map is actually not very hard, instead it's fun! I always like to spam on BFGs and rockets. However,
I can say this map is quite aggressive since there's 592 monsters. 

The beginning is not very hard if you just kill the shotgun guys in one corner, but taking care of ammo is needed,
since shotgun ammo is quite limited in the beginning. My favourite part is the zombieman killing with chaingun, 
cha-cha using the chaingun against them is so fun!!! As for that cyberdemon, I use a safer method. The traditional
method is to BFG him after getting the red key, but this is very dangerous since the area is quite small. I try to 
BFG the cyberdmon in a larger space which is swarmed with demons, and this work is much easier. I was also happy 
that I can finish all teleporting archviles in the end with a very short time. ^^

I really hope I can finish this map within 14 minutes, and I was really happy I can done it! If I do kill that
missing revenant fast, I should have done with 13:4X.
