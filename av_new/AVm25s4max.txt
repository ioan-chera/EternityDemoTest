Comments:
Since I sent my older demo in this map, I felt I had to be a little bit
more fearless I didn't like the time, that's why I made this, it is a
very large map compared to the most of AV, but I really love this
only for this map ;) first part of demo wasn't optimal, as I made
a lot of mistakes there and I lost a lot of seconds foolishly. As for
the second part of the map, I can say I was slower than my older
demo but it looked better instead, I miscaculated BFG ammo so...
I had no BFG to kill the last Cyber, ah! it was so annoying moreover
I wanted to use BFG to kill the "red key horde" but it wasn't as
planned to, that made me lose so much time, this is so embarrasing
since all went wrong, I neither killed red key horde neither kill Cyber.
