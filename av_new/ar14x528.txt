 Since the Nightmare! 100% Secrets record was already done my Xit-Vono
  I thought I would do it on -Respawn. At first it seemed so difficult,
  but when you are in -Respawn it is an "advantage" that there are many
  monsters, since you can provoke infighting, then come and kill some
  extra little monsters so you do not have to kill big monsters.
