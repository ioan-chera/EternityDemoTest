Description:

Many doomers consider this legendary map to be the most impressive level ever.
My personal most beloved map is HR26, but AV20 is also one of my all-time
favorites (about on par with Deus Vult Map04 and Eternal's Gravity.wad). And
unlike some people, I just love that majestic, thrilling mountain section, and
I think this map wouldn't be SO epic and atmospheric without it. 

There is an old Alien Vendetta review by NoPoet, written highly creatively
and eloquently. For example, I really recommend reading his Map20 description:

When I first played this level in 2004, it was just as tough for me as HR24, and
much harder than AV25/AV26 (though still easier than HR26, AV27, Scythe Map30
and HR2 Map32). It felt so long, and dangerous from beginning to end. My first
survival time was 55:58, and it's nice that today I can do it in under 1000
seconds (16:40).

Under 16 minutes of course doable, but sub-16:40 was already challenging enough
for me. I agree with what Tatsurd said about the difficulties of this run in his
previous TXT's. Demo has some slow ugly actions in the final third, but overall
turned out reasonably smooth, and the end went just the way I wanted :-)
