WAD: Alien Vendetta
Maps: many of them
Time: Various (see below)
Added Engine: prboom-plus v2.5.0.2
Category: nomonsters speed

Here's av again... 1 mo' time. I realized my old nomonsters runs could still
be trimmed down, as I was a bit lazy and rushed the recordings. Well, here, I
hope I do better work and make better demos. :)

I know Cacatou has made a demopack as well and many of his times are better
than mine since he found different routes and improved on those (nice work
once again, man!), but here I use many of the same routes that I did last
time, which I've improved. I also included a long demo of MAP20 which goes
through the entire map. Cacatou's demopack has the shortcut.

You'll see some maps without demos, and this is the point where I said screw
it when I saw Cacatou's demopack go up. :P

I show the name of the map, the time, and how much I improved on each map
from the last demopack I had up. If I omitted a map from the last demopack,
I just put -0:00 under improvements. Some of these are quite major!

MAP:					TIME:		DIFF FROM 
							LAST DEMOPACK:

MAP01 (Sunset):				0:28.91			-0:02
Comments: First I got 30.06, then I tried for 29. I would have been satisfied
with 29... except that I got 29.06 right after the 30.06, so I tried for 28.
The result was many more 29's, and even a couple of 30's got mixed in with the
bunch. Finally, I got the desired time. I realize the demo could look a bit
more polished than this, but I doubt I can get that many ticks faster and find
a 27 somewhere.
MAP02 (Rusty Rage):			0:18.86			-0:06
Comments: Note that the old demo for this was in my FIRST demopack for av.
The keygrab is quite a bit annoying, lucky I got it so fast here. After you
get the general idea, it becomes easier, but it's still annoying. Very nice
map, though.
MAP03 (Cargo Depot):			0:16.57			-0:37	
Comments: Finally, I got the darn glide to work. Too bad I have trouble
getting 15 or 14.
MAP04 (Seclusion):			1:04.80			-0:05
Comments: I tried, but couldn't beat this.. I really wanted to see myself
get under a minute here, too.. oh well, somebody else will have to do it
if a < minute demo is put up for this map.
MAP05 (Crimson Tide):			0:40.77			-0:04
Comments: Originally I was just going to go for 41, but after 5 minutes of
playing I realized that I got 41.74 pretty easy. I thought I should push it
another second. It was kinda hard to do, but now I have a 40 without any
SR50 or fancy rocket boosts. I'm happy. :)
MAP06 (Hillside Siege):			1:08.89			-0:07
Comments: I got a few 1:09's and 1:10's before this. Using a little SR50 +
rubbing against the tree after the RK allows you to jump over the railing
right down to the RK door. I had not done this in my two previous demos.
MAP07 (Showdown):			OMITTED		       (-0:00)
Comments: Cannot be done in nomonsters.
MAP08 (Beast Island):			1:03.74			-0:04
Comments: I got 1:05 then thought I should push it down to 1:04. When I 
got 1:04, it was 1:04.09. I got this afterward. The reason I turn around 
on the ledge at the end is because I usually have to run back up the stairs
there; I don't typically make it.
MAP09 (Castle Gardens):			0:30.89			-0:05
Comments: First I got 33.91, and it had some mistakes, so I thought I should
push it down to 32. Within 3 more tries, I got 32.63, so I figured I should
try for 31. I tried quite a bit for 31, then after a while I got 31.06. I
was mad, so I had to go for 30. Right after the 31.06 demo, I got this.
Strange, isn't it? I probably can't get sub30.
MAP10 (Toxic Touch):			1:49.69			-0:10
Comments: I didn't spend a lot of time on this one. I just wanted 1:4x.
MAP11 (Nemesis):			0:42.46		(NONE)	-0:00
Comments: I didn't do this one in the last two demopacks. It's really not
so bad with the RJ. RJ requires only running backwards if you get the right
angle. Cool map.
MAP12 (Entropy):			0:58.60			-0:02
Comments: Hard to improve much with all the annoying elevators. 
MAP13 (Suicidal Tendencies):		1:32.83			-0:03
Comments: Meh. Can't get this to 1:30, just like Scythe 2 MAP27. When I
tried improving this, all I got were low 1:33's.
MAP14 (Overwhelming Odds):		2:05.71			-0:01
Comments: There's not a lot of room for improvement unless there's another
route or trick which makes this faster (e.g. a BK grab that doesn't make
the door close). Right now I'm not aware of one.
MAP15 (Bulls on Parade-normal exit):
Comments:
MAP15 (Bulls on Parade-secret exit):
Comments:
MAP16 (Mutual Destruction):		1:16.34			-0:03
Comments: I thought this was going to be fun to re-record. However, it was
a huge pain. I kept getting 1:18, then 1:17.03. After that, I got more 1:18's
and failed attempts. I freaking hate that invulnerability sphere, and every
time I have to run over those linedefs, I pray I'll miss it (like here). It
makes everything so hard to see if you grab it. Then, after you press all
the switches and teleport, you have to jump down the rocks. Doing this is
not too hard, but trying to get down as quick as you can usually results in
you falling into the lava and dying. I know this can easily be 1:15, but
I don't even care. 1:16 was my target and I'm keeping it.
MAP17 (Nukefall):			0:30.57			-0:08
Comments: There's a red skull bar glide trick that can be used. Unfortunately,
this is hard to pull off just once, so getting it twice quickly w/o TAS
would require quite a combination of luck and skill. I decided just to go
the long way here, getting RSK, then opening up one set of bars. At the
end, there's another "glide" (very easy to do) that can be accomplished
because of some metal bars being lowered. I tried many times after this to
get it sub30, but I couldn't do it.
MAP18 (Lake Poison):			1:30.97			-0:06
Comments: Yeah, I'm happy with this one! :) A couple of bumps are present,
but I think this one is pretty good.
MAP19 (Alien Resurrection):
Comments:
MAP20 (Misri Halek):			4:47.37		(NONE)	-0:00
Comments: One of the maps I left out last time. This map is very long, the
biggest in AV, and it's not easy, either. Parts that make me grimace are
around 0:51 (climbing the rocks) and 3:37 (jumping down those layers of
rock). Hey, you have to give a keyboarder a little credit for hating those
parts. :P Most of the battle here for nomonsters is remembering every little
thing about the route. Even in this demo, after some practice, you can see
points where I have to slow down to think a little bit and other points
where I'm sure of myself. The running here is jerky due to so many winding
halls, and I bump on so many things. I hope this demo isn't crap, but I
don't want to spend any more time here. My target time was under 5 minutes.
MAP21 (One Flew Over the Caco's Nest): 	0:30.69			-0:07
Comments: First, I got many 33's, then came 32's.. 32.00 really annoyed
me. After that, more 32's, then a 31.37. I tried again and right after
that got 30.69. Interesting. Love the map, but it's hard for a good speed-
run, especially in nomonsters.
MAP22 (Rubicon):			0:51.91			-0:05
Comments: I didn't expect to improve the time this much. 
MAP23 (Blood Sacrifice):		1:21.91		(NONE)	-0:00
Comments: 1:21 was actually pretty hard to get. Fortunately my friends on
ZDaemon encouraged me to go for it. :) This map actually isn't too bad once
you learn the route. I was just lazy earlier in my other demopacks.
MAP24 (Clandestine Complex):		1:01.34			-0:15
Comments: I didn't get it under a minute, but oh well. This is ok but lazy.
MAP25 (Demonic Hordes):

MAP26 (Dark Dome):

MAP28 (Whispering Shadows):
Comments:
MAP29 (Fire Walk with Me):		1:15.43			-0:10
Comments: Even before I started, my target time was 1:15. I began with a 
1:18, and worked it down from there. A major improvement from last time is
using SR50 to help aid a useful jump. Just after the first switch and be-
fore the YSK, there are lava stairs leading down to a lava fall. Sort of
across from that is a ledge, which you will need to be on (wheter you jump
to it or fall down the lava and use the stairs to the right). Obviously,
jumping is faster. Getting the jump is a little tricky, but with the right
angle, it's easy with a little SR50. From there, it's just running and 
hoping you don't bump into too many things.
MAP30 (Point Dreadful):

MAP31 (Killer Colors-normal exit):

MAP32 (No Gust No Glory):		0:30.66			-0:02
Comments: Another time in the 3x second range that I knew I should push
down to 30. Can't get this one under 30, either.

I hope you enjoy this demopack. :)
