Entropy is a chemistry word seen in thermodynamics, it's the measure of energy not available for useful work in a 
thermodynamic process. 

This map is easy, the main hard area is the 2nd part, which have many teleporting monsters. It got a chance that 
barons or hell knights may block you and dead, so make sure you get the BFG or plasma gun ready.

After that part, the remaining part is quite easy, except that you have to be careful of the teleporting archvile.

And yep, this map should be done below 10 minutes!
