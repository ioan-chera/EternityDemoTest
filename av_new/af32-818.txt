  Recorded using Doom 2 Version 1.9
  Doom2 -file av.wad -playdemo with version 1.9

  Alien Vendetta – Map 32 – UV Fast

Finally, I got this beast finished. This is pretty much the same as the -fast run on the 1st release, albeit with a few changes to the route and safer. As such, the ending sucks, but it's going to be as is. Besides, it's not like anybody else is gonna try a faster route.
