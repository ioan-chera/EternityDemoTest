Demo entry #76 (because it's uploaded very lately, on January 2, 2011).

Description:

This is a very old demo, and earlier I didn't want to publish it because I
felt it's a not-too-impressive, cheap run. Today, after Tatsurd uploaded
his 0:59, I decided to publish my old 0:49 in order to showcase some faster
approaches to a few parts of the run. With good stamina, one can utilize
enough luck to achieve a time close to 40 seconds. Enjoy pulling it out!
