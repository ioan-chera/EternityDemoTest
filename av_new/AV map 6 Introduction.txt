This map is very hard, it is the 2nd hardest level in episode 1, which hardest is map11 Nemesis. There are many
luck based to get a fast run, I try my best to get below 9 minutes, and now it's done!

There are 4 hard parts in this map. First the beginning, which is swarmed with cacodemons, zombies and imps. Then
the mancubus and hell knights, getting them to infight isn't much problem, but to make sure all of them killing
each other, it's not a easy work. 3rd area the mancubus cliff, which is a pain to me. I just try to kill them one
by one either SSG or rocket launcher. 4rd area is the hardest, the open cyberdemon court. I just kill everything
behind the door either rocket launcher or SSG for safety reason. Telefrag the cyberdemon takes luck, it got a 
chance that the cyberdemon moves away and hit you.

After all these 4 hard parts, the remaining parts are relatively easy. I made a silly mistake by forgetting to
press the switch and lower the pilars at the end.

This is already my very best run in this map. I don't think I can do it any better, this map is hard.
