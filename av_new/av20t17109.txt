Hah, I can't believe I've managed this. Took me about 2 weeks of 
practise, constant changes in route, discovering all additional 
oddities and raging, neverending raging.

I'm not going to spoil the demo with boring route details, but I have
to mention that I've chosen this way of doing stuff mainly to avoid
all-ghost bugs, which happen way too often when ammo starts to pile
up at the spot... you'll know which one.

Also, if you're hoping for some sexy cyber punching action, I'm going
to heavily disappoint you. The map gets cheesed as much as possible.

Hopefully this will please all the midi fans, so they can finally get
bored of it.
