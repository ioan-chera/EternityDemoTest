Nice grind here for 29 seconds. When I ran 30 seconds for my demopack, I
knew the time could be well below 30. Today I was looking over some of
Cacatou's times and decided that I wanted to take more records back other
than just the 3 demos I made for my pack that already beat his. This map
came to mind instantly. I thought, oh I'll load up and get 29 quickly 
enough and it'll be simple.

Cacatou has some really nice demos, with times that are very hard to
beat. After 10 minutes from starting and warming up, I got 30.94. This
is where I thought, oh it'll only take another 20-30 minutes.

1 hour and 20 minutes later, I finally got this. The only time where
I didn't majorly screw up going down the curved stairs to the red door,
the stairs after the red door, and that hall at the end. On the bright
side I've managed to complete this sub30 now.

I'm tired already from this map with the time I've spent on it, but I think
28 or 27 is achievable if you're good. Enjoy! :)
