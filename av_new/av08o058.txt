Ok, going for 57 was too frustrating. I swear the walls in the first 20 seconds have arms that try to grab you, the first teleporter is ridiculously easy to
skip, there are still issues with the wall the narrow ledge rests against wanting to throw me to the ground and kill my run, and even if all that goes well,
there are still two jumps that can mess up a good run right at the end.

First, the SR50 jump shortcut. Big thanks to GrumpyCat for pointing this out to me; my unobservant self never thought of it. It's a good shortcut, easy for
an SR50 jump, but the problem is getting it first try when you don't want to waste a lot of time setting up. It's pretty much luck-based at that point. I
probably got it 1/4 times I even got to that point and didn't mess up on earlier crap.

Same goes for the jump to the switch that opens the exit. I found this one a little easier to do quickly, probably got it in every 1/3 runs where I got to
that point, and it doesn't require me to stop and press my SR50 key.

I got this demo in about 30 minutes, but after another 90 of trying to get 57, there's no progress. I managed to get another 58, some tics slower, however...

Yes, this got past the point of fun for me. I hate releasing a low 58, but I need to quit wasting my time on this. I still love this map, but I need a break.
Maybe I'll go for 57 at some point later if nobody else does. No guarantees, though.
