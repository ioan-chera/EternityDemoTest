Comments:
I really enjoyed this, but I'm slow yet, sometimes I play safely when
I have to be agressive and when I can play calm I get nervious about
time I make mistakes a lot, specially on strafefunning (I got stuck
easly on narrow places), time is not that bad but it can be improved it
with no much effort... I want to get near world record or perhaps...
beat it.
