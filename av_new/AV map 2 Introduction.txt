This map is a little bit hard, this is due to many shotgun guys and chaingunners. I just play this map one place 
to another for safety.

The teleporting revenant in SSG area need to be careful to kill since place is quite small. Other from this, the
only real difficulty is the archvile. I shoot rockets to him to prevent him going up the cargo base.

Anyway, I still satisfied with my run.
