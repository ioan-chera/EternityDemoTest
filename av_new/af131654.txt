Hard level, but my curiosity led me to do this. The first part can be a bit of a pain, but not too bad. All the shotgunners can sort of screw me over and kill me, but it happened to me less often than not. That hallway with all the zombies can actually take away some health, but not much here. After that, I start to get nervous, especially with a couple of low health moments. The ending can really be improved, but I doubt anyone's going to do that.
