Geez!, I wasn't expected I succeded in getting megasphere at first time!
obviously when you playback this demo you will notice it,
when demo was starting I was only playing without thinking if it will look
good but as demo was going on I saw I was going further than I ever
imagine, so... I wasn't expected to get in zone where red key is, and when
I got in there I was terrifyied thinking "what the hell am I doing here?,
if I make only one mistake this lucky demo would be finished, I have to
avoid screw this one up", that's why I played extra deffensive in that
zone, fortunately after fighting twin cyber, all went okay and calm.
btw, since this was not planned I guess I can improve this demo with a
more offensive play style, but I have to spend a lot tries because in this
map all can change suddenly (armor and enemies attacks are troublesome,
one attack you recieve and all is gone)
