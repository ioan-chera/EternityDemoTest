Comments:  

   A demo for another WAD. I wanted to test a level for Alien's
   Vendetta since it is more difficult than Memento Mori and hence
   a good TAS challenge. This is not the most difficult level of
   AV, but it seems good with all those monsters. I will be trying
   some other levels of this WAD an then I guess I am going to do
   something 'bigger'.
