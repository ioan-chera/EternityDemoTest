  Description:
  ha, what a fluke! i was trying this run for a few weeks, waiting exactly for this
  kind of glide luck. and when do i get it? i didn't get picked in captain selection
  for a ctf game, so i went to pout in a bit of singleplayer... :)

  the weapon switch is timed wrong, so cg comes up, but it might be actually faster
  this way. i'm killing some of the imps on the left from the glide spot, cause their
  shots bumped me away too often. the exit time is 24.14 thanks to my lazy, relaxed
  finish sprint, but i'm not too bothered to repeat it.
