Professional doomers can finish this map within 3 minutes. I try many times to do it, but I can't. So I think 
setting the target as 4 minutes is better. I try my best to done faster so that I can save more time, and I use 
3:27. The 1st run is 4:05.

This map isn't very difficult, except for too many revenants. I try to kill just 2 HKs with the plasma gun at
that rocket launcher area, I hope to save it for killing the teleporting revenants in the yellow key area.

Time can be improved if the last area can deal it faster. Any I just satisfied with 3:27.
