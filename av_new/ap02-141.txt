Comments:  At first I wanted to do this the quick way, without the soulsphere, but I just didn't have enough patience and went for the safer route after all.
           In the exit room it is possible to get a zombieman to block that silver thingy. This time it didn't happen but luckily I had enough health to survive some hits.
		   The yellow key grab is extremely difficult/random, possibly the hardest grab I've ever seen.
		   I've also included my best attempt at the "quick route" in this archive.
