
Here are three failed demos showing my progress at tysoning Alien Vendetta map 13.
I kept my best attempts (based on kill count) to motivate myself.
In some sense these are not fails, but successes.
Because each of them was at one point my best attempt.

This is how the kill count progressed, quite fast actually:

185/592
253/592
546/592
592/592
