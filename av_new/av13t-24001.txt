===================================

What is the map with highest monster count that has been tysoned?
Is it maybe this one?
Here we have 592 monsters doored to death in 2 hours 40 minutes and 1 second.
The theme here is DOOR TRACKS!
Monsters get stuck on door tracks a lot in this map.
Door tracks help controlling the cyber, which was crucial.
Cyber was like a pet to me.
I felt like a shepherd with a cyberdog who was herding sheep for me.
So, cyberdog kills almost every sheep in the level.
The rest of the monsters are dealt with another kind of DOOR ABUSE!
So much door abuse here!
So much patience required!
Sometimes I have it.
Now I had it.
Thanks to the level designers for the fast doors.
Monsters can't open fast doors.
Doors are like riot shields.
I feel like a sheperd with a cyberdog and a riot shield, so basically Jesus.
Anyway, this map put the patience and endurance requirements on a whole new level.
If there are pauses, it is for various reasons.
At around 77:24 I had to go and pee, sorry about that.
During the run I also had to change the volume to hear the cyber better.
That's not all.
Another program suddenly popped up and switched the window focus.
Luckily nothing dangerous was around me when it happened.
In two hours there's plenty of room for making absolutely stupid mistakes.
Sometimes I take shots to the face for seemingly no reason.
The spider demon was the worst moment.
It never had this much healt on my previous attempts,
so I had not practiced killing it with pistol.
Apart from real mistakes I made there is a special one at the end.
The final bite from the last sheep is intentional.
I knew I was succesful, so I let the sheep bite me for fun.
All of the sheep come from digital Hell anyway, so there's nothing Jesus can do for them.
So, when I let the last sheep bite my Jesus hand the sheep was already doomed.
Similarly doomed was one of my runs that got the all-ghosts bug.
It happened in the long hallway filled with zombiemen and nice linedefs.
I never want to shoot with pistol in that loooong room.
I also got a rare "signal 11" error that crashed the game ruining one attempt.
Surprisingly, this run took maybe 10 good attempts only,
not counting runs that ended immediately at the start.
Still, each good attempt took easily more than an hour,
so I started playing very very carefully at the end.
A monster can very easily get in the room with me,
if I close a door too slow.
It happened often until I learned to be more patient and careful.
To make it more reliable I basically just press space, nothing else.
Anyway, after learning to use the cyberdog and riot shields effectively
and killing more than 500 monsters,
there was still the final challenge:
THE 9 ARCH-VILES! NINE!
At first it seemed impossible.
That was because I tried to let my pet cyberdog kill them.
It always caused extreme chaos and a funny death.
Sometimes the arch-viles even resurrected ghosts,
which obviously ruined the run.
There seemed to be no solution,
but then I realized I could just door more.
EVEN MORE DOOR ABUSE! LOL!
It was a "heureka" moment.
Strange that it took me a while to see the possibility.
I guess I was too much concentrating on the cyber strategy.
This must be the maximum amount of door opening ever in any run.
Can somebody make a tool that counts how many times I open a door during the run?
For me, this game is not called DOOM anymore.
This game is called...
DOOR.
