  Alien Vendetta – Map 19 – UV Fast

Yet another -fast table-filler. The first part up to getting the red key is tricky, but after that, it shouldn't be too difficult. The last 3 minutes are a bit nervously played, due to the couple of arch-viles around I want to kill ASAP but can't until everybody else is. The cyberdemon can also be pretty gut-wrenching as well.
