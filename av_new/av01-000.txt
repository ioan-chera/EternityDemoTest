map01: It doesn't look megafast, but i swear :23 is veeery far away and most likely is impossible in non-built demo.

map02: At first i decided to pick up rocket launcher, which gave me  :13 run. Well, some lousy wimp stood on the way, and
the RL wasn't taken fast. I tried to improve that attempt, but could only get 13:4x and there weren't any visible mistakes,
plus i had only 9% of health in the end. Then i've remembered that i'd skip half of map03, and rerecorded the demo, now 
leaving the RL behind. Damn, should plan everything beforehand from now on :)

map03: You cannot even imagine how happy i was when i got this down to :11 finally. Getting a low 12sec wasn't hard, i
needed only hour and half to get it. I've got a very fast (and lucky) glide in the end of that demo. If i'd got my usual glide,
then the demo would have been some 12:5x and probably i would left it unimproved. Also the chainers cooperated
well. To improve the demo i needed to replicate everything from start, but make it faster. And then i had to repeat a
quick glide. 9 hours of step by step running, 3 of which were spent on chainers (it was my best pass! Could have been
0.2-0.3 faster), and 3 - on glide. 

map04: My first finish here was :59, mainly because i didn't conserve health and had to pick up more medikits. Also
i was slowed down in two places. Here i fix all of these problems. Of course, the time can still be optimized, though
the run is pretty good.
