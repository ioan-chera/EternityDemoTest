  Description:
  I've been trying this route from time to time for a few months, whenever I felt zen
  and calm and stuff... and I always ended up raging, seeing red (THE NAME?!!) This is
  so about bullshit luck. Take just the first hallway, kill a sarge with the pistol and pass
  with reasonable health is like a dice toss. Grabbing the YK, getting past the demon,
  lucking out with the chainees on the RK, etc. Ugh, it just goes on and on, uncomfortably
  reminding me of my torment on p204.

  It's still very flawed, but I wanted 24 and I got less, so screw this level and screw
  all the hitscanners along the way. I didn't even get the grab at first and I don't care.
  I've included a TAS that shows how it SHOULD look if I got all the luck in the world.
