Despite this demo's ugliness, I played for over an hour on this map and
can't seem to do better. :/ I know that under 2 minutes is very possible,
but my patience is thinning and I want to give my hands a break.

That being said, somebody's gotta prove that this can be done under 2
minutes. Even if that person is not me, I'd be very happy to see a 1:5x
time or better (maybe there's a different route... but I highly doubt
that).

At least in this demo the elevator-switch trick worked well here. Sometimes
that switch can be annoying and not want to be pressed as soon as you start
trying from below. Other walls just scream "bump into me," and that exit
trigger is rather easy to run right through (which happened to me once,
leading to a 2:02 demo). Despite all that, I think this map is actually
pretty fun, and you have good scenery along the way as you're strafing
through.
