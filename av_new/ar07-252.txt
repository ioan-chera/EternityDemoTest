Comments:
Easier said than done. Everything up to the two switches is nothing difficult, if I have good control at the time. However, I kept screwing up that last rocket jump at the end which screwed up most of my attempts. It ended up being easier in PrBoom than in doom2.exe. Finally, I had an attempt which got that rocket jump. Chances are, had I not gotten those 3 hitscanners near the end, this run would only be seen through my own eyes.
