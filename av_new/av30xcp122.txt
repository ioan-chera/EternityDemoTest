Description: 
Obviously slower than the UV-Speed, but this is done pacifist.

I have spent some time recently looking into void glides 
and I've discovered so many different angles being possible.
Naturally I saw the corners on AV map 30 as I've been planning to
do a d2all uv-speed and I noticed the deathmatch part of the map.
So I clipped into the void to see if I could move anywhere, turns 
out you can reach the exit switch!

I've tried finding a spot where you can gain enough momentum to
go through without having to resort to coop, but unfortunately
I couldn't find anything. Might still be possible, but for now
a coop demo shows the trick.

Also I didn't notice the second megasphere so I wasted some time, 
I didn't really care about the time even though it's TAS.
