  Description:

  First exit, time 2:30, 100% kills, x% items and... blah, 0% secrets :/
  I don´t take insvibility...

  So, next run - UV MAX as well, but time 2:53.
  OK, this is my second max exit, too bad. But, I sayed on #nightmare:
  <DooMerMan> Anders: first times is always bad, or no?
  
  I think, yeah, that´s right.
  You (anyone, really) don´t need luck for beat this run...
