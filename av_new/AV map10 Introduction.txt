This map take place in a toxic treatment plant, and it is swarmed with a lot of zombies, as well as some imps and
demons, archviles etc.

As what tatsurd have said before, zombies attack are unavoidable. There's lot of toxic waste in this map, but 
there's no radiation suit. You also can't get an armor until the later part of this map, which is inside a fake 
wall in the red key area. Therefore getting to low health is easy. The hardest area is probably the mancubus area,
which I usually dead in that part. Other from this, the last part is also quite tough. I try to kill the 
chaingunners first then the monsters at the lower level to save time.

A very nice map with a very nice music, "Plasma" from Duke Nukem 3D is one of my favourite music. This map also
have a great and beautiful design, which makes this map as one of my favourite map in AV.
