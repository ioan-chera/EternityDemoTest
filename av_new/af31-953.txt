  Alien Vendetta – Map 31 – UV Fast

Basically, same as Xit Vono's recent NM demos on this map, just without respawning enemies. Of course, this demo just happens to have a linedef skip at the blue key where they cacodemons don't appear, as well as a cyberdemon that shoots at the baron for the usual 3 shots even though he's already dead. Like Xit said, the red portion has some tricky parts, but everything else is somewhat trivial.
