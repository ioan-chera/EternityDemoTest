Attention!!!
For playback use only PRBoom and only prboom-plus.exe
This demo jerky as hell BECAUSE OF IT use 'smooth factor' more than '7'. '9' is good.
Turn off pallete on pain otherwise you will see only red screen XD.

About demo:
I made something insane. And i regret about it.
It's like you got ticket to your future life where you can only die die die die die and so on....
Uhhh. Can say that moment with Cacodemons were hardest but saved me two factors: Lucky and MEGASPHERE there.
Suddenly noticed that i can catch it.
Also was problems with 'death exit'. I couldn't catch moment.

Also thanks to 'dew' for "good luck" XD.
