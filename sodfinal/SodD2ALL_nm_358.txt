My favourite wad. It's not the gift. It's diamond.
I had only one 'pick' (tool) and i must go deeper. Go down down down. 
'dew' and 'GrumpyCat' just showed me best way and 'j4rio' showed me secret places where i can to rest.
I finally got it. And it will be... My KAWAI (X_X)...

About Run:
Copied 'dew' movement. Somewhere found new trick and so on.
Anyway stupid decision. Not even expected than i will so fucked. My ass was splitted by million pieces from such hardcore... 
in Scythe 2 i got problems only in five maps,
Here each map on this skill... It poses a real threat. Not only for run but for nervous system.
NEVER... DO YOU HEAR ME? NEVER TRY REPEAT IT. CARE ABOUT YOURSELF AND ABOUT YOUR PATIENCE>>>

About Complevel:
Nine is good for more diffuculty. Skill '5' is not enoooooouuugh.
Also i'm not sure about 'playback' on original Boom because FPS will be so looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwww....

About MAPS:

Difficult for run:
QS - Quite Simple
PH - Pretty Hard
HAF - Hard As F###
IMP - Impossible survive without TAS

MAP01 - {QS} Nothing interesting.

MAP02 - {PH} Here i could use 'death exit' but i can't finish MAP03 faster than 1:30
Also i allowed here one mistake with lever but i found it after finished MAP03 so i don't give a shit.

MAP03 - {HAF} (<_<)

MAP04 - {PH} Nothing interesting.

MAP05 - {PH} I can't make glide while Cacodemon attacks me so i waited when this '''' will get up.

MAP06 - {QS} Found that AV jump suddenly. Also BFG9000 helped me so much on next levels.

MAP07 - {PH} Nothing interesting.

MAP08 - {QS} Nothing interesting.

MAP09 - {PH} Just be fast and everything will be fine. 

MAP10 - {PH} Problems with linedef skip i got here in end... Feels like on Unknow action linedef skip doesn't work.

MAP11 - {PH} Huge jump... Why 'dew' not use it i don't know. Could kill imps from rocketlauncher anyway.

MAP12 - {PH} 'dew' not necessary coping movements exactly as it is because linedef skip works fine without Rocketjump.

MAP13 - {QS} Nothing interesting.

MAP14 - {QS} ..... What? Before this i tryed 'dew' route and got 45 secs. But i didn't like it and rerun it.

MAP15 - {PH} Nothing interesting. Skipped first wallrun because imp's projectile not allowed it to me.

MAP16 - {PH} Nothing interesting.

MAP17 - {HAF} AV jump was hardest trick here.

MAP18 - {PH} Nothing interesting.

MAP19 - {PH} Nothing interesting

MAP20 - {HAF} Nothing interesting.

MAP21 - {PH} Nothing interesting.

MAP22 - {PH} Nothing interesting.

MAP23 - {HAF} Nothing interesting.

MAP24 - {HAF} How i hate that map.... Uhhhh...

MAP25 - {HAF} Nothing interesting.

MAP26 - {HAF} Nothing interesting.

MAP27 - {HAF} Nothing interesting.

MAP28 - {IMP} Actually i already knew route but just repeat sometimes so hard. I was shocked because i finished that map
faster in 11 secs. Moment with Cacodemons was good

MAP29 - {PH} Nothing interesting.

MAP30 - {HAF} Just fooling around. I so love that map.

Thanks to dew, j4rio and GrumpyCat.

P.S problems with skipsec i got after MAP28 but i didn't waited over 1 minute... Of course less because i skipped secret
maps... But it can't be compared with Sunder.wad where i spent more than 3 minute on waiting.
