Comments:  I tried to reproduce dew's excellent UV-Speed without shooting.
           Yes, this run is ugly!
           But the most time save event is of course two spiders at the end.
           This part is luck based, so i needed as many tries as possible,
           even with such ugly mistakes in the middle...
           I like three 0:58 runs much more, they are cleaner and without av mess at the end.
