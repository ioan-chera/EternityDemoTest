Recorded with : PrBoom 2.5.0 -complevel 9
Date : 1st of February, 2014

Level comments : Very nice map, using a cool mix of sewer and "Darkbase" textures.
		This is the first time we get a Super Shotgun in Speed of Doom, and
		of course there's a major step up in the opposition you'll face once 
		you get this weapon.

		The perspective of recording demos on this map was daunting at first for
		me, as I remembered a maze-y layout with plenty of slime-filled corridors and
		even a crate maze... But after a few playthroughs, as usual, everything became much more
		clear, and even the crate maze was actually a small-sized room, and that's a very good thing :)

		This level is immensely fun to play in UV Max. Great music too, fits well with the overall pace.

Demo comments : This is my best attempt so far... I can't seem to get any closer to Tatsurd's DSDA time
		( I won't even mention Qaatar here, as obviously he's not from this planet ).

		Better rocket management should help me reducing the time here, but for now I don't 
		have much spare time left to improve.
