Map19: Impure Serenity
UV Max in 8:55
-complevel 9

The beginning was inspired by Qaatar's UV Max run. The later parts was taken quite slowly, especially getting to the plasma rifle. The arachnotrons often blocked me,
which made that part of run slow. Getting the cyberdemon to warp to the start by shooting at him and then telefragging him made the run much easier and smoother.
Time could've been faster, but it was at least under 9 minutes.
