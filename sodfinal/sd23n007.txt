Comments:  Graim's UV-Speed route is practically impossible here:
           target is too far and you need additional boost.
           And or course on MN chaingunners don't want to move and help you.
           So i decided to make two jumps: one to the mancubi island and then to the exit.
           Second jump is much easier when arch-vile kills you because
           in this case he don't push you away from your trajectory,
           just bumps you up, and you can slide under the cyber.
           I tried it time to time starting last summer =)
           Several days ago i got three 0:08 and today low 0:07.
           0:06 is doable with awaking arch-vile by shooting, but then it's messy as hell.
