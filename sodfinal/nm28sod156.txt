 This run is a request from Azuruish.

 The two towers were the hardest parts. I wasn't sure whether
 those tricks were possible. In the yellow skull tower not only
 you must stay alive yourself and preserve some hp for the jump,
 but also keep AV ticking as well. And you gotta do it fast. There
 were attempts where AV died from only one pistol shot! In the
 second (final) tower the problem was to catch 2 AV at the same
 time and lower the platform while keeping AV's attention. That
 was quite a challenge. Enjoy!
