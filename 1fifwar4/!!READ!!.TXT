 NEW IN AOL! The REoL TOUGH DOOM LEVEL HELPLINE! As of this writing, you
 will find the helpline under KEYWORD:PC GAMES. Select the MESSAGE BOARD 
 and go to the GENERAL topic. Look for REoL TOUGH DOOM level helpline!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         ***** NOTE ON GAMEPLAY *****

JERKY LAND! That's right, even you Pentium owners (from e-mail I got) are
            going to suffer somewhat! You will need a fast 486 or better!
            (See CPU Requirements below.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This game can be played in all modes. In 1 or multi-player games, you'll
start out in a rather small room trying to find your way around the dump,
since there is quite a bit of retracing of your steps. Since there are
quite a few Barrons to shoot holes into, you might want to have a few of 
your fellow friends help you out. You can have up to four Doomheads going
at it agianst the Barrons, and (up to) 495 enemies going at you all at
once! And to think, that's one of TWO war zones here!
  In DEATHMATCH, You have the chaingun, and that's it! ALL of you will 
start REoL close to each other, so this could be short and sweet!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO PLAY THE NEW LEVEL

At the DOOM prompt, type:          DOOM -FILE WAR5.WAD

You can choose the level of diffuculty you want, but will be quite jerky.
As always, HEY, NOT TOO ROUGH is meant to play like ULTRA-VIOLENCE in the
TOTAL WAR series of REoL TOUGH DOOM levels!

        CPU REQUIREMENTS: You will need a 486 pc of at least 20MHz or
        better in this ultra jerky enviornment. Even Pentiums are known
        to suffer a little!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 STORY:

    Once again, you are at home watching your soap operas and talk shows
when yet another special report comes across the tube. You were real up-
set about this, because you were watching 90210! You march your way to
Kenedy Airport and fly to the Washington to meet with the Pentagon to ask
why they had to interrupt the episode where Brendon was cheating on his
girlfriends. "It's those daemons from Hell again", said Colonel Sanders,
"they have taken over a top secret millitary bomb shelter enormous in
size." Sanders gives you a map of the main areas of the bomb shelter.
You were warned about the "Fiffy Room" (you'll know it when you see it)
where there are (up to) "99 WAYS TO DIE" coming out of each letter of
that one famous name in the floor. You know this is going to be a tough
mission, so you may want to bring a few friends along so you can evenly
divide the mere 495 enemies teleporting their way into the Fiffy Room.
     What fun this will be! You then find a square area on the floor
which makes a door open up in the room you're in. You then find out you
are not finished after all! You then walk into a large courtyard too big
to make fighting enemies tough, untill you open the big wooden door on
the other end of the courtyard....
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              PLAYING TIPS:

(1) THIS IS QUITE JERKY! Take movements at small intervals, or simply DO
    NOT RUN! If you run, you'll have REoL bad control of the action!

(2) GRAB THAT SHOTGUN! Can't miss it. It's in front of you!

(3) This game has a few "puzzles" to solve. This may require you to search
    the entire level (depending on where you go) to find certain doors
    and switches. Some doors and teleporters are blocked by poles display-
    ing different colored skulls. This (approximately) tells you what
    section of the level to search through to raise the poles. Secrets
    blocked by poles require secret areas to be found to raise them.

(4) When you release Barrons, try to get them in one of the bigger rooms,
    ESPECIALLY THE MAIN HALL! As you progress through the level, there
    will be even MORE room to battle these pink boneheads!

(5) Try the Spamburger while you're there. I hear it's good!

(6) This level was brought to you today by the letters R, and K, and
    by the number 15.

(7) Emergency "Exit": In the event you are being mauled by a mere, say,
    495 baddies (could be 500 or more), there are teleporters in certain
    rooms on opposite ends of the map which will teleport you from end to
    end. Nice, huh? You can sneak up on your daemon friends (or your reg-
    ular friends) that way.
    NOTE: These teleporters are monster impassable. This does NOT mean
         that staying inside the teleporter will be safe, in fact, it's
         the OPPOSITE! How will you get out of a jam if you let daemons
         block the way out?

(8) There is one secret where you'll be out of reach from hell's baddies.
    If you run out of ammo, there is no room where you're standing to get
    ammo. MAKE SURE you have plenty with you!
    NOTE: Again, the secret enterance to this place is monster impassable.
         You could end up in a jam here too, unless....

(9) To the right of the big wooden door of the Fiffy Room is a room full
    of ammo (as well as a few other big rooms with the same use).

(10) You can get up to almost 300% in armor, if you know where to look.

(11) Don't microwave your food for any longer the directions on the food
     package says, or your food will actually be cooked, or even burnt!

(12) Also note that if the enemies are coming into the weapon rooms, there
     are emergency exits located near the opposite end of the rooms. 
     This is almost as good as the teleporter theory used!

(13) You'll be greeted at the exit switch (it's not marked as an exit).
     A Cyberdemon will be guarding it! Why do you supose there are big
     towers near this area?

(14) When in Rome, do what the Romans do.

(15) IMPORTANT! In one of the rooms, you'll notice a small enclosed area
     with teleporters at each corner. If you can find out how to get in
     there, I wouldn't do so until you kill EVERYONE in the first war zone
     (the Fiffy Room)! You'll go DOWN if you don't (or even become
     trapped)!

(16) SECRETS ARE SECRET: As usual (since REoL TOUGH: The Pit), all of the
     secrets in this level (and I mean ALL) WILL NOT SHOW even when you
     try to use the all-map cheat code! HA, HA, HA, HA, HA! All that you
     will ever see are the rooms and corridors you'll be walking through.

(17) There is enough health kits (stimpaks, med kits, and berserks) to be
     able to complete this level fairly easilly, if used when needed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known "Boo-boo's":

(1) The main wooden door into the Fiffy Room is suposed to stay open at
    all times, but the daemons somehow close it on occasion. If you are in
    this room, just climb the steps and open the door by pressing the
    space bar. If you're on the OTHER side (main corridor), you'll have to
    hit the green switch again. This is the switch in the blue keyed area
    inside the room on the far left corner (you can see the switch from
    this room through a little window). Usually the daemons will open the
    door again, if there are enough there.

(2) ENEMIES SEE THROUGH WALLS: Well, sometimes you'll hear grunts of
    enemies before you even get to them, or they'll be waiting for you
    right at the door(s)! Scout's motto: BE PREPARED!

(3) DOG BITES: Ouch! Go to the doctor and get checked out for Rabies!

(4) THE USUAL TOTAL WAR PROBLEM: Yep! Too many sprites to draw!

Elwin Hathat                            Why don't these morals ever 
                                        make any sense?  
                                        
Yacko                                   Because they're
                                        only put in to add a bit of 
                                        educational value to what is
                                        basically just senseless 
                                        violence (and senseless 
                                        entertainment) with no real
                                        redeeming qualities at all.
                                        AND NOW FOR...


Resident Expert of Leominster           TODAY'S MORAL: We were put on

                                                       waste time.


Elwin Hathat                            See, I was right--it doesn't 
                                        make sense, and it isn't even 
                                        particularly entertaining.


Dot                                     Who came up with this idea
                                        anyway?

Elwin Hathat                            Oh . . . I just love the
