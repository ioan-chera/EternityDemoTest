Oh, how fitting of you, Fiffy.  Get some goodwill from me by putting out a level
that's evidently improved from your previous levels (REoL Tough: St. Lucifer's
Church, or FIFFY5.WAD,) and then piss it all away with /this/ level.  Thanks,
pal!  And yes, this, as of this writing, is the longest non-FDA demo I have ever
recorded.  It is /not,/ however, because the level is long in any way.  Not at
all.

I'll get to the explanation for all of that in a moment, but first, let me talk
about the rest of the level.  This, the fifth level in the Total War series, is
a subverted base which, as per Total War protocol, is absolutely stuffed with
monsters.  The first problem is that playing it as Fiffy likely intended you to
play it is /tedious./  You start out with a shotgun, and then a chaingun, and
you don't get a stronger weapon until later in the map.  And most of your
enemies are barons.  I had to cheat to find out where the stronger weapons were,
because I didn't feel like wasting an hour shotgunning barons to death.
Eventually, you get to the nefarious Fiffy Room, where monsters teleport in by
the dozens.  However, as usual, Fiffy dumps a zillion cells and rockets in
storage facilities that open when you get there, so you can't possibly run out
of ammo no matter how much you suck.  The final battle?  Pfft... /What/ final
battle?  You face two cyberdemons and a spiderdemon protecting a switch, but
it's trivial to get at least one of the cyberdemons to fight the latter, and
jump past them to hit the switch, not to mention fighting them on your own is
far too easy.  He calls this level an entry in the "Total War" series, but it'd
be more accurately titled "Total Bore."

So why am I annoyed by this level, and why does this demo take so long?  Because
this level has the absolute worst monster teleporters I have ever seen in a Doom
level.  They're regular teleporters in the wall which are 64×64 map units
wide... in rooms which are 640×640 map units in size.  And among the monsters
are pinkies, who are 60 map units wide.  It's a good thing the secret
teleporters allow you to warp into four of these monster boxes and slay them,
because you have to wait absolutely forever for them to come out.  And it's
possible for a monster to /block/ one of the teleporters from being entered,
making the other monsters take even /longer/ to come out -- which I discovered
when I wondered why they were taking longer to appear than usual in this demo
and used the automap cheat.  These monster teleporters are even /worse/ than the
ones in Total War II!  And after you kill all of those slow-to-appear monsters,
the one remaining pinky puts his best efforts into refusing to enter the
teleporter; thus, I have to exit the level with 99% Kills because I don't want
to wait 20 /more/ minutes just for /one monster/ to warp in.  The rest of the
level was mediocre at best, but the monster teleporters team up to effortlessly
sink the entire WAD.

As I mentioned, this is the longest non-FDA demo I've ever done.  When I saw the
final time, coupled with some of the boneheaded errors I make and the fact that
I used the automap cheat while waiting for the last remaining monsters, I wasn't
sure I even /wanted/ to post this demo.  Ultimately, I decided to do so, just to
show prospective level designers exactly what happens when your monster
teleporters suck.  Enjoy the rest of the demo, I guess.
