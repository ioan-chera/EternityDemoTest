                       STUFF YOU NEED TO KNOW

        This level is for DOOM 2 Level 07. I chose level 7 because it has
my favorite music in the game. This is NOT a sloppy level, no fuckups,
it was nodes built perfectly, all textures are aligned (at least the really
noticable ones, I didn't really feel like driving my self insane!). This is
also an extremely complex and compact level and is very large. I spent
a long time on this level and would like to see it circulated to other BBS's
(just make sure you include the three files in Matrix.Zip if you do), and
just for the record, I REALLY hate making DOOM levels. It takes too fucking 
long |(.

        Note: For some reason the percentage at the end of the level only                     
              goes up to 75% on the secrets, go figure. So if you get 75%
              you'll know that you got all the secrets. Everything else
              is normal.

                  SHIT YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW

        This is my FIRST level, some of you out there ought to be ashamed
of yourselves (you know who you are!!). I tried to combine my favorite levels
into this one and still throw in some original ideas too. If you're an avid
DOOM player you might recognize some areas. I live in Vermon (Hermon), Maine.
I'm 17 years old and I make levels for a hobby, I do have a life (although
sometimes it doesn't feel like it). I HATE, no make that DESPISE (C)rap,
and listen to nothing but the best HEAVY METAL (METALLICA, OZZY, MEGADETH, etc.)
My name is (yeah right), my alias is Kamakazi or The Denominator, and I plan
on making about three more levels, just so you'll have something pleasant to
the eye to play and not a big pile of shit someone slapped together ;).

        Well I guess that's it for now sizzle chest. Rock On, Metallica Rulz,
Seinfeld is awsome, MTV sucks, look for Cringe in the future, and most 
importantly take it easy. See ya later fruit cake :).

P.S. I would like to thank Id Software for making DOOM, it kicks fucking ass,
     and I would encourage anyone to go out and buy it :-o.
