        CRAP115 is E1M7 of the DOOM episode Fava Beans (The Madness of 
Mergatroid).  CRAP115 is when the level was only about half done...notice
the large #.  I usually save up to 200 times per level...and also notice
that it isn't called Titan.  I usually think of the names after I'm all 
done.  So, it was dubbed "crap" for the time being.  The .lmp that goes with 
this is sure to make you laugh.  It features myself and a friend taking turns
flying out of a very high window (with the help of a rocket launcher).  It is
quite funny :)  Most of the windows in my levels are passible with the help 
of a rocket (as this demo shows).  For you WAD makers who haven't discovered
this funny fact, just make sure the window floor is 24 units off the ground
and that the window itself is at least 32 units high.  This makes for a very
funny deathmatch game if you get the right shots in :)  
        By the way, the long pauses in the demo are from my friend and I
typing to each other.  Also, notice the changes that took place from CRAP115
to E1M7, i.e. Titan's Anomaly.
