Title  : Room 101 (101.WAD)
Author : Sock

This DOOM level is a collection of all the best ideas from all the levels 
that I have constructed over the past 6 months. It was designed as a 1 player 
level, although multiplayer starts have been added. Room 101 makes use of  
the first four skill levels, but I did not bother testing this level with 
Nightmare mode as it is extremely silly.

It is possible to complete on Ultra Violence level without CHEATS in about
20-40 minutes (100% on Kill and Secret scores) depending on how well you 
known the level. I recommend you do not start at a high skill level but 
work thru the skill levels as each level is slightly different. By doing 
this you will get more familiar with the levels layout and will be able to 
complete the higher skill levels much easier. 

I spent a long time making sure all the wall textures line up correctly as I 
am a bit of perfectionist. This is the main reason for this level taking 
so long to construct and test. All the puzzles are not too difficult, but one 
comment I did have back from the testers is that certain puzzles cannot be 
completed easily with a mouse.

>> The story

As with all doom levels, there is no story just violence and death !!!
But for all you sad people (like me) this is the story ....

H.Q have discovered that the aliens have started to set up bases upon
planet Earth.  Far up in the mountains the creatures of Hell have setup a
heavy attack force of their best fighters.  The only way into this base
is by parachute as the only opening is defended by high stone walls.
Once landed you must seek out all forms of life and destroy them without 
mercy... (This is so sad ...)
