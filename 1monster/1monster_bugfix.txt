For some reason it was never uploaded to the archives. I've removed the resources and
the levels that haven't changed in order to save space. Included maps: 03, 04, 05, 07, 10,
11, 17, 20, 23.

Thanks to justanotherfool for providing the file.

Update 3/31/11: I've added a fix for MAP03; 100% Kills is always possible, now.
