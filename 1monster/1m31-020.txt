Here's another 1 Monster UV speed demo, this time on Dutch Devil's MAP31, the
sole secret level and the one with the Wolfenstein SS as the enemy.  I started
recording on this level shortly before I went to watch Indiana Jones and
the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and continued shortly after I came back from
watching it.  Given that Indy's former recurring enemies were the Nazis (in the
new film, set in 1957 during the Cold War, the villains are Russian,) I felt
that recording on the level where Nazis are the enemies was quite appropriate.
Anyway, as you can expect, this level is built with a mix of Wolfenstein an
d Doom textures, with some additional 128×128 textures from the Jaguar/Mac/3DO
ports of Wolfenstein added on... except Dutch Devil didn't skimp out on
detailing.  At all.  Despite the obvious Doom II MAP31/MAP32 theme, it's just as
detailed as Dutch's other map in this project (MAP13.)  And strangely enough, it
/works./

It also plays well, from what I see.  Speeding through it, however, is rather
tough.  Given that the Nazis are hitscan enemies, it's basically impossible to
run through this level without taking a lot of damage.  Making things worse are
things you can get caught on easily, like pillars in the middle of rooms and
hallways, and the metal borders of the walls.  Fortunately, it's a very short
level, as it's a short trip from the start to the key, and from the key to the
exit.  There are no tricks here, apart from the fact that the mass teleport of
Nazis in the exit room doesn't happen.  Just like with MAP05, this is because
it only occurs if you fire a shot in a certain location, this time in the second
room.  However, I don't fire a shot the entire time, so nobody warps in.  Yes,
this is a pacifist demo, too!

My first time was :23.  After I came back from the film, I got :22, and then
:21.  Finally, I got :20 after a long, frustrating struggle, and then another
:20 that was faster by a couple of tics.  I hope you enjoy it!

Prior to recording Doom demos, I did some usermap speedruns for Duke Nukem 3D.
Video versions can be seen on my YouTube channel at

"Speedruns" section up on my website in the near future.
