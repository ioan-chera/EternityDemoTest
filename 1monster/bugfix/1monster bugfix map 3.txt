Comments: It's been a while since i recorded a doom demo so i decided to try this map out, this time i used the bugfix version of the wad so 100% kills is always possible now. After going into the secret room i decided that the chaingun is best used there and then take out the sergeants from the secret room area, in the exit room i used the shotgun and got a much faster time than before, it's very risky since without infighting you can get killed very quickly by the sergeants there.
