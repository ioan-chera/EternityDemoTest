Yet another 1 Monster UV speed demo, which I recorded shortly after I did
1m05-139.  The first of the two Arch-Vile levels, this one's set in a
dilapidated building trapped in a subverted landscape, and was designed by a
man who has since been banned from Doomworld for linking to the Heretic IWAD.
Speedrunning on this level requires a fair degree of luck in the beginning,
as the Arch-Vile that attacks you earliest can very well initiate his spell as
you're climbing crates to the first switch.  You can also get blocked very
easily in the hallway leading to the red key, as not only are Arch-Viles huge,
but they're the fastest enemies in the game!  Once you get the key and drop
down, there's a suit of green armor that's meant to be obtainable only after
destroying some barrels, but you can grab it through the barrels by
straferunning.  Combined with the soul sphere you get before the red key, this
will make any subsequent Arch-Vile blasts you suffer far more bearable.  The
rest of the map is straightforward from there.

This is actually my first exit.  My first unrecorded time on this was :49, so
I was hoping to get a time of :48... and ended up getting :45!  I think this
is the result of the fact that I ended up doing Arch-Vile jumps two times in
succession.  While I don't pull off any shortcuts, I do reach my destinations
faster as a result.  In the end, I decided not to improve it any further.

Prior to recording Doom demos, I did some usermap speedruns for Duke Nukem 3D.
Video versions can be seen on my YouTube channel at
http://youtube.com/profile?user=TheGreenHerring, and I hope to have a
"Speedruns" section up on my website in the near future.

By the way, you may be wondering what those funky pictures at the end of the
level are.  Those were the Doomworld avatars of a few of the authors of this
megawad at the time they developed it.  However, they are all in an irregular
size: 36×36, with deldelda's avatar in size 36×33.  While you don't have to
worry about the tutti-fruitti effect in Boom, the horizontal size of a wall
texture /must/ be an increment of 32, or the texture will get cut off past 32
pixels wide when it's tiled.  As a result, none of the avatars are rendered
correctly in Boom.  These avatars, and the "1M" written on the upper floor,
make for a rather bizarre break of the fourth wall.  I can understand it if
these were in a secret room, but when they're in the /exit room/ of what is
otherwise a /serious/ level, it's quite strange.
