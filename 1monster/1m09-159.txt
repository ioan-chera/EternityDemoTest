Comments: 
I haven't recorded much as of late (Addiction, thy name is Cabal Online).  Was having a looksee around the Misc Demos thread and saw a recent string of 1 monster demos.  Quick downloaded it, picked out map 9, and did a quick UV-Speed of it.

Nothing to really say about speeding this level, just try to dodge around the Lost Souls as you hit switches and grab keys.

Final room...after triggering a large amount of souls to start teleporting in, look for the BFG to help keep the number down until the exit lowers.

All in all, pretty good run considering I was shooting for under 2 minutes.  Didn't take long, only around 15-20 minutes.
