I know it's just 4 tics away, but I don't want to try again for 3:23. With
a map this long, the hundredths of seconds kind of become less important,
unless you get .97 or something, in which case you're pretty excited.

My goal was under 3:30. I was mad when I got low 3:28's twice, both having
sloppy moments. I had to improve. Consequently, I kept recording, and got
this after about 20 minutes. Hopefully this one doesn't look quite as
erroneous and sloppy. :)

Optimal probably lies in the 3:1x range for this route, ofc if a better
route is discovered it can be much faster. Enjoy!
