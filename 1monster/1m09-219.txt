Not much to say. This level is atmospheric, but hordes of lost souls aren't a whole lot of fun. Also it looks like it isn't possible to get 100% kills here, so my demo is actually a very slow speedrun. I don't like the level enough to want to improve it just now, but I think it's clear that I had forgotten where I was supposed to be going at the start of the map (on account of not spending any time getting to know the level).
   Also took my time finding the BFG. I was amused to see that it was right in front of me several times, but I failed to notice it.
