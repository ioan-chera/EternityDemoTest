Comments:  
Argh, for some reason I only got 66% of secrets here. I'm pretty sure I visited all the secret areas though? I assume it had to have been the slime river secret, mustn't have triggered the secret sector. I'll try again shortly, but I can't be bothered at the moment.
   Apart from that problem the demo is relatively sound. The time is reasonable, I think. Dangerous map. If you're too hasty, you can very easily get killed. Great fun, though.
