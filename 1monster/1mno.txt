WAD: 1monster
MAP: MAP02-MAP21, MAP23, MAP31
Time: Various (See below)
Added Engine: prboom-plus v2.5.1.3
Category: nomonsters speed
Recorded on: (See below)

I decided to try 1monster again.. 0monster style upon seeing other players'
runs deleted from the table for accidental constant SR50 use. Also, this
great WAD (my favorite) could use some better nomonsters runs, so here we
go! 

MAP01 and MAP22 were left out because they contain nomonsters demos that I
could not beat. MAP24 was left out because nomonsters is essentially the
same thing as UV-Speed, and it already has some nice demos there.

Comments are below.

MAP	MAP TITLE			TIME		TIME SAVED FROM LAST PACK

MAP02 (Hangar of Evil):			0:38.94			-0:06
Recorded on: October 29, 2013
Comments: Not bad, perhaps with better running this could get to 37 or 36,
but I doubt I can run it under 38.

MAP03 (Sergeant Center):		0:32.89			-0:05
Recorded on: October 29, 2013
Comments: I got a lot of low 34's when I first started recording this,
then after about 10 minutes of getting 34.1x and 34.0x, I suddenly got a
33.14. Fortunately 32 came 3 tries later. :)

MAP04 (Imptech Rampage):		1:19.97			-0:13
Recorded on: October 29, 2013
Comments: Even for me, a keyboarder, this map is surprisingly fun to run
without monsters, despite its linearity and long, narrow hallways. I guess
the layout sort of reminds me of tnt, my favorite IWAD. I set my target
time to 1:25 before starting, but I got 1:24 on my second try, so I had to
go lower. This attempt is bumpy.. I thought I would redo it since it'd be
a low 1:20, but it turns out it was 1:19.97 and I was happy, so I'm keeping
this demo.

MAP05 (Infested):			1:22.43			-0:20
Recorded on: October 31, 2013
Comments: This map is rather annoying. The jump at the start works about
half the time thanks to SR50, so failing a lot in the first 10 seconds is
not fun. After that, it usually goes pretty well until the underground
rock area with the barrels. That is, unless you don't mess up on hitting
one of the tiny switches. You would not believe how easy it is to miss
a barrel unless you speedran this yourself. About 25% (1 in 4) of my 
attempts that lasted long ended here, either missing a barrel or dying
because I did not get out of the way in time. From there, it's easy to
get caught on things in narrow hallways, so at times my demos were just
too sloppy to be accepted around the BK area. After grabbing the BK, you
must backtrack (not as annoying but still kinda) and go to the blue bars.
About half my attempts that lasted that long failed there because I would
not be angled properly and lose time trying to open the bars while being
in a proper angle. I know in this demo, I lost about half or 3/4 of a second
getting caught on a barrel in the end, but screw it, I'm done here. 1:22
is plenty good for me, especially after having spent an hour on this map.
Two good things I can say about this map are that it's very nicely designed,
appealing to the eye, and that it's rather fun for tyson play. Overall it's
just annoying when going for a general speedrun.

MAP06 (Claws of the Imp):		1:19.51			-0:14	
Recorded on: November 4, 2013
Comments: The best demo I got after a few attempts. I'm not particularly
fond of this map in any mode; imo 02 and 04 are the better imp maps and
more fun on nomonsters, too. This map is not overall bad, though, rather
it's not exactly my style.

MAP07 (Arachnophobia):			0:55.63			-0:01		
Recorded on: November 4, 2013
Comments: PLAYS BACK WITH 1monster_bugfix.wad!
	This map is home to arachnotrons, my least favorite monster, so it's
nice to play it without them. Not my favorite map, but a good one nonethe-
less. Also it's nice to see a MAP07 with a possible exit in nomonsters.
Took me ~20 minutes just for this improvement, so I'll stop here.

MAP08 (Buckshot Waltz):			1:17.86			-0:01		
Recorded on: November 5, 2013
Comments: It wasn't as hard as I thought to beat my old time. It only took
~40 minutes. Barrel trick gave me some trouble a lot of times so I had to
restart from there a lot. Other times, I was just too sloppy, which also
slowed me down. Here, it went excellent from just before the YK area all
the way to the last room. Last room is a little sloppy since I got excited
seeing that walkover-activated door open at 1:05. Fortunately it's a high
1:17 still. 1:16 would take quite a bit more work for me, but I think it's
highly possible.

MAP09 (Chamber of Souls):		1:39.54			-0:18
Recorded on: November 5, 2013
Comments: After getting 1:50 as a first exit, I immediately set my target
time to sub 1:40. Took ~15 minutes, so this was a pretty easy one.

MAP10 (Un-Named 118):			2:03.89			-0:05		
Recorded on: November 5, 2013
Comments: 2:00 seems a bit out of reach, unfortunately (unless you're
Looper). I got this in like 10 minutes but I doubt I can really improve
it a full second.

MAP11 (Mausoleum):			1:57.46			-0:08
Recorded on: November 24, 2013
Comments: After taking a break from this due to school keeping me busy, I
decided to start recording again since I'm on vacation. I got this in 5
tries. :P What a blast! I never knew under 2 minutes would be this easy!

MAP12 (Baron Citadel):			0:54.94			-0:02
Recorded on: November 25, 2013
Comments: Not as hard as I initially thought to do this, even though many
times I screwed up at the start or ended with 55. Comparably, this was
about half as hard as av09o029 was for me. Now it's finally under 55! :)
Hopefully I've wrested this from Light_Speed for the last time, because
I won't have much fun if I have to go for 52! Good job with your 55, bro.
Took a bit for me to beat it. ;)

MAP13 (Workin' on the Chain Gang):	1:03.80			-0:09	
Recorded on: November 25, 2013
Comments: Nice, easy, relaxing one after running Baron Citadel. 10 minute
work, but I'm stopping here since I like the demo. Still has a couple
minor mistakes, though. Anybody for under 1 minute?

MAP14 (Crucified Factory):		0:43.71			-0:04
Recorded on: November 25, 2013
Comments: A fairly meh-type demo demonstrating the elevator trick. It'd be
cool if somebody found a way to jump on that ledge outside via the crates
from the RSK area and shortcut over to the penultimate area. Unfortunately,
I've tried a bit and it seems impossible without tools; just not enough
space in the RSK area to get a good SR jump going.

MAP15 (Spook House - normal exit):	1:37.29			-0:06
Recorded on: November 26, 2013
Comments: It's only 29 hundredths of a second but mehhhhh I don't want to
do it again now. :P

MAP15s (Spook House - secret exit):	1:29.86			-0:06
Recorded on: November 26, 2013
Comments: Recorded a 1:31 before this, but my initial target was under
1:30. Only took ~20 minutes to meet it, but I'm happy.

MAP16 (Mancublood):			2:16.77			-0:38
Recorded on: November 30, 2013
Comments: One of the demos which is much better than the first one I made
because it's much less sloppy. This demo still has a few sloppy bits, but
I don't know what to say except that they're inevitable in a map this long.
BTW at the end when I turned the wrong way after coming up that long, dark
stairway, I didn't lose time because I still had to wait for the bridge to
the exit to rise.

MAP17 (Zumma):				2:39.77			-2:42
Recorded on: November 30, 2013
Comments: My time saved is longer than the time of this demo lolol. Shows
how sloppy I was back then and how much I really didn't give a crap how my
demos turned out. Ironically, you don't need the blue key, even though there
is a "blue switch" for entering the last area. Time can be cut if you use
odysseyofnoises' (Light_Speed's) glide trick, but I thought meh, I don't
want to waste a lot of time doing that nonTAS for a general, unexciting 
demo. For that matter, if you want to see an actual GOOD run of this map,
I highly recommend watching Light_Speed's UV-Speed in 1:51.

MAP18 (Knightmare):			1:48.97			-0:22
Recorded on: November 30, 2013
Comments: Looks pretty good and I'm quite happy to have a .97 at the end of
the time. :) Nice map, but it's just way too easy to skip linedefs that you
need to trigger (that's why I walked slowly up the stairs at the last tele-
porter). Also near the beginning a few hanging decoration items are blocking,
where realistically you could walk underneath them, which can make a few
attempts go screwy if you get stuck on seemingly nothing. Very nice design
and level flow for the map.

MAP19 (Cacophony):			3:22.74			-0:02
Recorded on: December 1, 2013
Comments: Not bad, run is fairly smooth with still a few wallbumps. Makes
me think optimum without discovering a better route is mid 3:1x. Fortunately
this isn't .09 like my 3:24 demo was!

MAP20 (Bony Encounter):			1:55.83			-0:51
Recorded on: December 1, 2013
Comments: Glad I easily got this under 2 minutes. Improvements can still be
made, but it's much better than my old demo. One of my favorite PCorf maps
since it doesn't seem to consist of all rectangle-shaped architecture, and
that it has a nice, open layout.

MAP21 (Cyberswat):			1:07.89			-0:11
Recorded on: December 1, 2013
Comments: Just a general reduction in sloppiness saved some time, along
with a quicker jump to that switch which lowers the BSK. Another cool PCorf
map; the RSK room reminds me of the blue switch room from the previous map.
Anybody for under a minute here?

MAP23 (Musical BBQ):			1:42.63			-0:00
							     (NO PREVIOUS)
Recorded on: December 1, 2013
Comments: Cool map, route is pretty straightforward and there's a trick in
the second room with an elevator (after the blue door). It's pretty difficult
to get both switches pressed after lowering the elevator and not having the
elevator rise again before you can make it onto it. That's why I pressed
one of the switches before sending the elevator down. I fumbled at the first
switch for about a second and a half, which is about average. I got lucky
with the second switch by pressing it immediately. What killed most of my
attempts here was not getting the second switch pressed before the elevator
went back up. I probably spent about 30-40 minutes here, so the run is so-so.

MAP31 (Castle Dorkenstein):		0:17.89			-0:01
Recorded on: December 1, 2013
Comments: I think an unexpected (but nice) boost from a red pillar at the
beginning and better running in general got me down to 17. Cool map, nice
detailed version of a Wolfenstein-style map.

TOTAL:			THIS PACK:	33:53	   TIME SAVED:	6:45

I hope you enjoy this pack, which is better than my previous demos, many
of which were crappy!
