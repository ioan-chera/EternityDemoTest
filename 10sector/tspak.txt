2. What's this
--------------

After Doug, Brad, Martin and Wim Vanrie finished the Darkening 2 package, Martin came up
with the idea of making a 10sector package too. But, since the wad has too many
levels for four players, we decided to ask other Doomers to join. We gladly welcomed
Arno, Albert, Ralf, Mike and Yashar. Unfortunately, we havent heard from Martin since
and fear he has some real life troubles.

Our goal was to finish every level from scratch on UV Max (where possible),
and we succeeded. Map 16 was impossible to finish due to a bug, map 28's impossible to
get 100% kills and map 31 too. We made map 30 a contest level which resulted in 4 demos. We also made a couple of impressive 'special' demos such as speed, pacifist, skill 1 etc.

So, we're very proud to present to you: "The 10 sector demo package".

-------------------------
3. How to run these demos
-------------------------

First make sure the 10sector wad and the demos are in the boom directory.
Then, run the .bat file included with this package and follow the menus to
playback the demos you want.

If the wad and the demos arent in your Boom directory, use these parameters:
Boom -file (the location of the 10sector.wad file) -playdemo (the location of
the demo you want to play)

6. Comments about demos
-----------------------

Map 01 - Mike
-------------

Undoubtedly the easiest map of 10sector.wad, it is, nevertheless, fun to play and well-constructed.  I think any time below 0:30 is pretty good on this map.  Maybe a doomgod could get below 20 seconds....

Map 02 - Ralf
-------------

You get the berserk pack right [actually left :)] at the start which makes
up for the limited ammo supply. The map itself is visually not too
appealing, maybe i just have seen one too many crate in FPS's. The monsters
are set up as an interesting mixture, fun level to play.

Map 03 - Wim
------------

Very fun map, the arch-vile can be a bitch but when you take 'em one by one
it's no problem. Short and sweet.

Map 04 - Wim
------------

Fun and easy map to finish. I skip as many monsters as possible 
and finish them with the bigger weapons later.

Map 05 - Arno
-------------

Nice little level, with very good ammo/monster balance.
Racing through the first part saves quite some time,
cause you can return with SSG and some monsters die from infighting.
My goal was 2:29 here, so I'm satisfied with this 2:15.

Map 06 - Yashar
---------------

I love the theme on this map, especially in the beginning. Good
mixture of textures, which makes it fun to play, quite good use of only 10
sectors, also it's got good gameplay. Not much to say about the demo itself,
i spent a bit more then 1 hour i think trying to get a decent time.

Map 07 - Albert
---------------

Good enemies-ammo balance here. But also plenty of room
to move around. In other words, a tough run for an
average speed-runner like me... :)
Well, I tried to do my best here. And most of all,
I got what I expected: a max demo under ten minutes.
Btw, when it comes to 'conventional' playing (this is, no
speed), this one is extraordinary fun as well.
I chose a safe strategy at the double archie trap zone.
For the rest of the map, I tried to take more risks...

Map 08 - Albert
---------------

Too many cons in this map in order to get a max demo, although
it keeps being quite intense. I had to avoid some straferunning
here to make sure all the triggers worked the right way.
Imo 100% kills ain't possible without some forced monster-fighting,
specially at the red door zones.
I was about to give up with this one... most of my tries ended at the
exit area (this is, before completing the telefragging sequence, heh).
Anyway, I'm very happy with the demo.

Map 09 - Doug
-------------

A very easy map. TAS time could be 1/2 of this.

Map 10 - Arno
-------------

Very hard level, unless you play very safe and slowly.
There are a lot of unfair situations, where you can go from 100 to 0 health in 2
seconds. It's a shame about the missed BFG shot in the exit, which costed about 5
seconds. The rest of the demo went very well, so I kept this one.

Map 11 - Wim
------------

Altough you'd think this map is pretty short, it took me a while to get
under 7min. This was the first (and last :-) demo which  accomplished
that mission. The cyberdemon at the end is pretty hard, but when you know how
to dodge his rockets in small spaces, he's dead (loaded with lead :-) meat.

Map 12 - Ralf
-------------

I love it. What the level lacks in architecture, which is quite basic but
looks good, does it make up with interesting monster setup. And monsters
they are, knights / barons / revenants by the dozen, one Cybie and the evil
Archvile pair. Smaller monsters are a mere distraction :). Hardcore Doomers
will go directly down to the yellow key pit, i have to kill the monsters
above it first. There is only one safe spot in the map if you don't shoot
rockets at nearby walls :). In advance of recording a bit target training on
a Cybie would be a wise move... i ran out of rockets in the end. I liked
getting SSG, blue armor and back pack right at the start so one can go
berserk instantly :).

Map 13 - Albert
---------------

It certainly can be done faster...and better.
Very fun map to play.

Map 14 - Albert
---------------

This run isn't as fast as the one I planned in my first tries. Simply
because some extra routes and strategies are required to get a max
demo. Otherwise some of the monsters (and some ammo too!) will never
teleport.

Map 15 - Doug
-------------

I recorded this and map31 the same night.
I hadn't even tried it before that.
The pace is slow, and I get caught in the exit area(which should be the secret exit, IMO -- opinionated fellow, aren't I).

Map 17 - Doug
-------------

Ugh. Lack of ammo at start really hurts the 
fun on this map.  Ebola playtest this thing?
I only finished the map 3 times... so this is
very carefully played.  Replaying it now just
aggravates me.
Also, it just happens that in this demo I have
trouble with the Baron key.  It's not that 
hard -- even for me.

Map 18 - Ralf
-------------

A level not too cool from the looks but interesting architecture. Many
thinking must have gone into monster placement which is superb... from the
monsters point of view :). Until half through the map you are under fire all
the time, where-ever you go you'll face some monsters and others will shoot
at you from a distance. Easy mission when just playing with savegames but
recording it all in one go was hell for me. The demo does look cowardly
played, now go away :).

Map 19 - Albert
---------------

I tried several strategies with this one. Not sure if it's optimal, but
it's the most comfortable for me actually.
One of my final choices was to clean up the Hell Knights zone before facing
the three Mancubi (whom I must blame most of my frustrated tries on, btw).
And then... the final open area (specially PE). Maybe I didn't play the map
enough to find out which their usual movements are, but anyways their behaviour
appears to be a bit unpredictable. Luckily I met them soon this time.
Nothing special at the exit, but some possible monster-fighting.

Map 20 - Brad
-------------

Map20 was pretty confusing, it all looks the same to me.  So I would pick
random hallways to go down and stuff.  On my 2574108th try I actually picked
all the right choices ;)  And you have that demo right here.  I don't think
the time is bad, but could be much improved by someone with a better memory.

Map 21 - Wim
------------

I'm sorry for the author, but this map was no fun at all. As you see in
this demo, the elevators are really anoying some times. Also, i had to
really study this map in my editor before i figured out which route to
follow.

Map 22 - Albert
---------------

This one may be my best demo of the package!
Simply because the map itself is pretty addictive;
I've been playing it for hours, searching for
the best ways to save some seconds.
And I still think it can be improved. My playing
isn't quite flawless here. Besides, I triggered a
switch twice (?).
Anyway who cares? I'm so happy with this run!

Map 23 - Yashar
---------------

Giddy up. The time could've been better but it takes too long, for
me anyway, to come up with a better time.

Map 24 - Wim
------------

Definitely one of the hardest levels in the wad. Mostly because
of the low ammount of ammo. That's one of the reasons i let the
monsters fight a bit. I'm glad i discovered how to keep that
arch-vile from teleporting. Otherwise, he's a real pain in the ass.

Map 25 - Yashar
---------------

Great use of 10 sectors, but the "textureing" could've been better.
Weak gameplay, keep getting stuck everywhere. Would be more fun with regular
doom2.exe. Decent demo in my opinion.

Map 26 - Mike
-------------

Big, tough map.  I kept getting hung up on structures as I tried to dodge monsters; that can be frustrating, but it's an essential part of the gameplay of this map.  The ammo is also not overly abundant, so you've got to use your head to get through this.  Mr. Spider ALMOST got me (down to 1% health at the finist), but I had just enought time.

Map 27 - Wim
------------

However the map looks pretty easy, it's quite difficult due
to the small hallways, thousands of obstacles :-) etc. That's
why i play more carefull than normal. 

Map 28 - Doug
-------------

Not a fantastic run, but good enough I think.
Btw, I had tried a speedrun MANY more times
than the maxdemo -- just too hard to do the 
redkey strafejump, then the archvile jump 
without getting stuck on a monster in that 
circle sector.

Map 29 - Yashar
---------------

Giddy up! This is my top-3 maps in this megawad. Reminds be alot of
Plutonia, which is the best, THE best, megawad ever made, and probably that
would ever be made. The gameplay, monsters placement, the new look, giddy up:)
Heh back to this map, it's too hard i think, at least with Boom. Anyway,
nice gameplay and style. The demo itself is pretty slow though, but i tried
the "fast-way" one/two weeks before the deadline, and i kept dying so i had
to play the "careful-way", recorded a little after the deadline.

Map 30 - Yashar
---------------

Another top-3 map, excellent theme and gameplay. Ok demo, the route
i used here was "found" by the other team-members, not many short-cuts so it
should be at least a bit difficult coming up with a better demo :)

Map 31 - Doug
-------------

I recorded this and map15 the same night.
I hadn't even tried it before that.
I didn't know how to get to the secret exit... that is how little I tested the map.
only 300/326 kills; very slow as well.

Map 32 - Mike
-------------

A number of the team members (and some of the doomworld judges) didn't seem to like this map much, but I think it's a VERY creative use of the 10 sector limitation.  I really like playing this map, but I could see how someone who liked to have a map that's "fast" wouldn't like this one - too many nooks and crannies that need to be searched for enemies, and it's easy to miss somebody.  But that's one of the reasons I like it - you never know when somebody is going to sneak up on you and do a tap-dance on your head.  Good map!!
