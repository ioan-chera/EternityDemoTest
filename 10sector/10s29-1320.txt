Comments: A very scrappy demo but whatever. The archie at 8:30 or so really surprised me,
	  that doesn't happen very often. Had a thousand and one exits where all the
	  monsters wouldn't teleport in or some other stupid shit happens which is just great. 
	  11:xx should be possible with this route and more aggressive playing but my
	  patience has reached it's limits for now. But it's a fun map to play though so
	  perhaps I'll have another go at it someday.
