Pwad:      10sector.wad
Map:       04
Category:  UV Max Demo
Exe:       Doom2.exe with Boom v2.02

Time:      2:04

Comments:  Could have probably been under two minutes; but
	   the more I tried to improve this time, the more the
	   monsters got on my way (specially after picking up
	   the backpack). So I gave up after some dozens of tries.
