Description: What a beautiful map! I love it. The most dificult part is 
             the room with Skeletons. But Anders was so kind, that he put
             it at the start. The room with hanged Imps made me really 
             laugh (thx Anders). This is my first demo I reached the exit. 
             I didn't play so risky as I normally do. Also I got a bit 
             nervous at the second part of the demo. You may ask why I am 
             uploading this ? I simply couldn't let you waiting. :) 
             But don't worry, I will definitely redo it soon. 
             
             note: pls, ignore the date of the lmp. It's obviously
                   a nonsense.
