 Eh, shame I had to get a good time on such an ugly run. This
 looks awful, but two bits you don't really notice go very very
 well - rocketing the hell knights / cacos and killing the
 revenants. Other than that, crap, some stupid fuckups like
 falling to the secret teleporter too early and some sub-optimal
 stuff like needing to SSG one of the barons. A really good run
 could push this sub-3:30 but i've lost patience. Route is
 Ryback's with some modifications of my own.
