Alien Vendetta UV lmp collection
--------------------------------

Recorded by Drew "stx-Vile" DeVore, Adam Hegyi, Jason Henry, Anders Johnsen, 
Radek Pecka, Esa "Espi" Repo, Chris "Ryback" Ratcliff, Henning Skogsto, 
Anthony Soto and Adam Williamson.

This is a collection of recorded demos (lmps) for all 32 levels of Alien
Vendetta. All lmps were recorded on skill 4 (Ultra-Violence), ending with at
least 100% kills and 100% secrets (where possible).

To playback these demos, put them in your doom2 directory and type:

        doom2 -file av.wad -playdemo av??-uv

where ?? is the level number.

Alien Vendetta is available at the Alien Vendetta hompage:
http://www.doom2.net/~av/

This pack was put together over a period of several months: as a result, 
A LOT of demos were recorded, in all sorts of categories - speed, -fast, 
tyson, nightmare etc. If all the demos in this pack haven't fully whetted 
your appetite and you're hungry for more, these miscellaneous demos 
can be downloaded from

http://www.doomworld.com/sda/av.htm

Some of these demos are pretty slow, but some are *very* entertaining :)


General Pack Comments
---------------------

Drew "stx-Vile" Devore
----------------------
This is the first demopack I have taken part in, and also the first 
batch of max demos I've ever recorded, so I hope they are enjoyable to 
watch.  I like the way these packs work out, with lots of players coming 
together to contribute to the final product, so I wish I was around when 
packs for wads like MM, MM2, or Requiem were being made.  I want to 
thank Anders and the gang for creating AV, which is a truly remarkable 
megawad, to say the least.  It's yet another testament to Doom's excellent 
replayability. :)

Well, I should start by noting I planned to involv myselfe alot more with the
recording of this pack. In a way that was my goal with AV in the first place,
to record a shitload of demos for it. Funny how things turn out. I think the
pack as a whole have some nice demos in it, a few levels coulda needed some more
sessions, but one shouldn't complain when one is too lazy to do anyhting about
it :P Thanks to Ryback for organizing the releas of it, to Doug for keeping
the AV table updated and everyone who contributed with demos. Not too different
from Henning, this will be my last involvment in a demopack (btw, thanks Hen
for going like, totally way over hill with your av comments, heh :P)
Have fun watching...


Radek Pecka
-----------
This is probably my LAST demo for a few months. I don't even
know when I come back, but this is life and I can't do anything
about that. Now I can say just one thing --> I'LL BE BACK !!!
I'm happy that I was a part of DooM circus for 2 years. Thanks
everyone in c-n for keeping DooM alive. KEEP ON DOOMING!


Chris "Ryback" Ratcliff
-----------------------
Not my first demopack by a long stretch, but this is certainly the 
biggest.  Alien Vendetta would have to be one of the most eagerly 
awaited Doom megawads ever, and the fact that it managed to live 
up to the hype just shows how good it is. These maps stretch the 
Doom engine in ways that wouldn't have been thought possible 
a few years ago. You can clearly see the influence of source ports
and their associated pwads: yet the result is a massive 23meg wad
that plays back flawlessly on vanilla doom2.exe. I think this
is something great :)

Also I have to say something about the demos you're about to 
watch. They're all great. (Yes, even mine :) The demo team gave itself
plenty of time to pull out improvements on certain levels, and 
there was some great competition; of which you're only seeing the 
results. Very difficult to choose favorites from this bunch, so 
I'll limit myself to my favorite demo from each player.
Anders Johnsen came along when we thought some times were
nearly optimised and showed us all wrong: his map02 in particular
is incredible. Henning only contributed one demo, typically
smooth and stylish and speedy. Radek also only had time to put in 
one demo - his map29 is just as good as you'd expect. 
Espi's map10, tight and action-packed. Jason Henry's map20 demo, showing
every corner of this brilliant, incredibly difficult level. Adam 
Williamson's tightly played map17 (even if he did steal my route :) 
Drew "Fearless" DeVore's exhausting map27 run.

It was great to be on a demopack stuffed full of such talented 
people. The keyboarders live still :)


Esa "Espi" Repo
---------------
Three of my demos were somehow spared from total butchery, which is a 
shame seeing how bad they are. :P I haven't had time to improve them 
myself either.


Henning Skogsto
---------------
I'm ashamed that I didn't record more demos for this great
megawad. It's truly (from my perspective) the best ever.
And further on every map is designed in such a unique way that
every doomer out there should be ashamed for not having
played them all. I also hope that this megawad will sometime
be a part of COMPET-N. The .wad itself can only make COMPET-N more
attractive and fun to be a part of.

On a side note conserning myself I have to say that this is my last
contribution to doom. (I know I have joked about these things before but
this time it's not meant to be a joke) Before I move on though I would
like to say a few things first.

First I have to say a big *THANK YOU* to Adam Hegyi for his never ending 
interest in doom and for everything he have done for doom and espessialy 
COMPET-N. I guess COMPET-N would be something I will always remember until 
the day I'm six feet under :) We (I know I have) had alot of fun during all 
the years we played for COMPET-N. But finaly
though, life has to go on ;)


Anthony Soto
------------
AV is a very good megawad. If I used the 3 point test of any great wad it
would get 1 full point for playability and 1/2 points for detail and 
design. Would have been the best wad of 2001 if it wasn't for the outstanding
work of Richard Wiles Slayer wadset. AV's high points are it's playability
and creativity in design. Some of the levels really show a stride towards
creating detail and design never seen in DOOM. 

AV suffers from a lack of discretion. If AV were a film it could use some
serious editing. Many wads have too many areas 'tact' on. I can feel that
whole "mine is bigger then yours" vibe. Someone should have took a broom
and swept out the bad parts of certain levels. Otherwise, I don't think
it would have hurt to see a new version of AV. I think it's just one of
those inevitable aspects of making a megawad. Megawads as early as Momento
Mori had to release bug fix versions. You just cannot anticipate everything.
I think Anders stuck with the idea of not breaking compatibilty in favor 
of fixing some nagging bugs. All he was really saving was some first, 
second, and maybe third effort runs. 

My contributions are just miscellaneous. I really only recorded what
I felt like.  Nice to see some diverse contributions to this pack from 
a variety of talented individuals. See ya at Compet-n!


Adam Williamson
---------------
Well, since Henna beat my MAP09 I guess I only get one map in this pack
:(. Not much to say really, thanks to Anders and his team for putting
together such an awesome map pack. MAP17 was great fun to play, except
for that damn cyberdemon :). Also big credits to the other players on
this pack, who all did great jobs too.


Here is a quick table listing all lmps - detailed descriptions come later.

Descriptions
------------

The descriptions were written by the team member who recorded the map.

AV-01 - Sunset
--------------
Neat clean map by Martin, one of my AV favs. third attempt demo, so don't 
expect much..


AV-02 - Rusty Rage
------------------
Ok demo I suppose, the imps in the towers can be annoying to kill off. Wish 
I put a barrel or two in each of them.


AV-03 - Cargo Depot
-------------------
Mattias Berggern map so its bound to be a fun one. Too many spectres in the 
bluekey garden tho. Again, demo is not too shitty timewise.


AV-04 - Seclution
-----------------
Superior in design to map03, another Matte map this one. Great gameplay too, 
so-so demo, didn't expect it to stay in the final pack.


AV-05 - Core Infection
----------------------
One of my better levels I belive. A few ugly moves in this demo, but 
timewise its decent.


AV-06 - Hillside Siege
----------------------
The start and end of the demo are decent I think, but the 
middle part is horrible and I take a lot of damage, but somehow manage to 
survive. Lucky enough to telefrag the cyberdemon too, not very easy to 
get that happen.


AV-07 - Showdown
----------------
[none received]


AV-08 - Beast Island
--------------------
Ugly.


AV-09 - Castle Gardens
----------------------
Nice map, it also provides a great gameplay. I gave it a few sessions
and steadily worked my way down timewise second by second, and when I
got the current time I decided that enough was enough :)


AV-10 - Chambers of War
-----------------------
Slow, but it gets the job done.


AV-11 - Toxic Touch
-------------------
I must advise against watching this demo. That's right, I said don't watch 
this demo. It's somewhere between not too good and downright bad. It's 
just one of those demos that can only be appreciated by my mother or
the level author himself. Well, my mom said she's not interested in 
watching the demo right now so that is definately a bad sign. And 
usually she'll sit down and watch our favorite lmp's together. She
said something or another about 'not having enough time to watch 
my exploration missions'. Yeah, well, you know.

One of the architectural masterpieces from AV. This level plays for the 
most part well also. I wish Martin would have stayed away from 
too much cave activity at the end. By then my nerves are fried and
not really happy about navigating 96 units wide caves. Some noticeable 
alignment problems, but otherwise, a great monster of a map.


AV-12 - Nemesis
---------------
I don't know what it is about Brad Spencer's maps that makes them so
unique... you can pick the author almost from the first room. Maybe it's
the ornamentation he manages to fit into even the barest square room.
Or the way levels seem inspired by eighties arcade games. The gameplay
is well balanced here, particularly the ammo... if you play too fast and
don't watch your supply you're bound to run out. On the other hand, the
design doesn't quite escape a feeling of room-passage-room-passage-room.

The demo is rough, but reasonably well optimised - I was familiar enough
with the level to be able to press forward with confidence most of the time.
Keep your ammo for dangerous situations and it's easy.


AV-13 - Suicidal Tendencies
---------------------------
I think this is as fast as I can push it.


AV-14 - Overwhelming Odds
-------------------------
Thanks go to Opulent for recording the first demos over this one; I 
didn't change his route at all.  I couldn't think of anything to say about 
this map before, I suppose the gameplay spoke for itself at the time.  
When I played through all of AV with savegames, I ran out of ammunition 
here, so I had to run past the hordes semi-pacifist style.. and my 
lucky ass made it, haw haw! :)


AV-15 - Bulls On Parade
-----------------------
This level is a real mixed bag, some OK bits and some terrible bits
(the outside arena with the revenants is not my cup of tea). In some
ways it feels undeveloped, especially the start area and the darkened
rooms after the outdoor arena. And I never know how to play that
crusher trap.

The end section, though, is good enough to make up for just about
all of this. If you hang around it's challenging, but it's faster
to zip back and finish the rest of the level :)


AV-16 - Mutual Destruction
--------------------------
A typical tight Brad Spencer map, with lots of attention to detail
and difficult fights. The start is chancy played fast, after that 
things calm down a little, right up to the revenant trap that tests 
if you're still awake :) The hardest part of the map is the Cybie
trap, you've got just enough time with the invuln to kill all of them, 
but you have to collect ammo, so you have to MAKE YOUR SHOTS COUNT.
In this demo this part went absurdly well, and I had so much ammo
the remainder of the level was a breeze...


AV-17 - Nukefall
----------------
Well, thought i'd try this some more tonight...it's a really frustrating run
but somehow I like it too :). Played for a MAP05 tyson for a while first -
sorry to offend Fish but if his demo had been any slower i'd've grown a beard
by the time I finished watching it - but got no luck there (well, actually,
I just screwed up a lot :>) so thought i'd try a couple of route changes i'd
discussed with Anders. Only one is used in this demo - I use fewer BFG shots
on the revenant packs and save up six so I can take the exit archviles down
much quicker. Very frustrating though, this fails often...they killed me three
times before this run came. Rest of the run is OK, the start is very nice but
there's a couple of stupid bits elsewhere. *Really* optimised run could maybe
just push under 3:00, but i'm happy being under 3:30 :).


AV-18 - Lake Poison
-------------------
I thought it was surprising that I was the only person who attempted 
this map.  It's an excellent map, so thanks go to Anders for making it.  
My favorite part of this map is the huge arena near the end.  With the 
BFG, lots of cells, and a surplus of spheres/armor, you can't go wrong 
here. :)


AV-19 - Alien Resurrection
--------------------------
Nobody else seemed keen on recording this map, so it was left to me.
The earlier sections of the map are the best, with simple, 
interesting monsterfights. The later sections, inside this huge 
building/arena, suffer too much from monsters just being piled on...
and you *desperately* need some armor here. Strange things tend to
happen too... in my first successful run here I got a ghost mancubus
who fell off the edge of the map and couldn't climb back up. And in
another try (not recorded) I had to deal with a ghost PE :)


AV-20 - Mishri Halek
--------------------
Beautiful map, but that $%@*!& spiral mountain had me wishing
that Kim Malde's mother had used birth control...(a megasphere
at the top would have been very nice, sir!)  Other tough parts
are the low-ammo start (I suck at Tyson) and the close-range
Cybies.  I also get totally lost at the end.  Under 26 minutes
certainly possible.


AV-21 - One Flew Over The Caco's Nest
-------------------------------------
This level kind of annoys me a bit. Anders says he did ammo balance and 
that he purposely made it so that beserk would be needed in certain
areas. I still think there is just not enough ammo to the point where I
feel I might as well make a tyson demo if I were to attempt a max demo.
The health is scarce too and made barely sufficient by an unmarked soul
sphere secret. You can get aggravated pretty fast when you die in the
final room because your trying to get a soul sphere secret (?) that is
behind a door located in a pool of -20 blood (?). GRR. It also is visually
a bit boring because Pablo's editor doesn't seem to be able to change
heights in a level. 


AV-22 - Rubicon
---------------
[none received]


AV-23 - Blood Sacrifice
-----------------------
This is a beautifully laid out castle level, totally linear, but great fun
to run through. A lot of effort has gone into the castle region itself, 
resulting in a multi-level but compact structure. Also the textures need 
to be mentioned: this level has a light, flecked gray look that's quite 
different to your average Doom castle. I got myself in some trouble 
in the demo, but it's not a hard level.


AV-24 - Demonic Hordes
----------------------
This is the huge mutha. 1696 monsters (out of AV's total of 11906 monsters, 
btw: almost one in every six AV monsters is waiting for you here :)
But don't worry, because the map isn't actually so hard as all that. 
It's big, but very simple. And the main strategy in most situations
is just to provoke monsterfights. When those run out, it's just
a left-right-and-centre BFG blastathon. 

My initial demo was over an hour long, after which Vincent said he thought
under thirty minutes should be possible... so I had to get that. A couple
of strategies help, in particular snatching the blue key early, and 
provoking monsterfights in several sections of the map simultaneously.

Just to illustrate how much infighting will help you: the total monster
hitpoints on this map is 51360, and the included demo runs for 1662 
seconds. That makes an average of 30.9 monster hit points per second, 
every second. By contrast, the plasma rifle takes an average of 26.3 hit
points per second. Assuming every cell hits something.

And that's *before* you take into account the roughly 300 monsters
resurrected by Archies... :) 


AV-25 - Valley of Echoes
------------------------
Thanks to Ryback for his run here, I didn't change the route again.  
This level.. phew, it really took me by surprise when I first played 
through it.  It's not only the fact that some areas are absolutely 
gigantic, but the way these parts are first introduced.  As an example, once 
you press the yellow switch and go down, into those underground 
passages.. you get dumped into a huge canyon with an army of mancubi, revenants, 
and cyberdemons.  If that wasn't enough, you take a lower path there 
into some more underground passages.. only to get dumped into ANOTHER 
huge area, with an island guarded by 10 cyberdemons.  It's quite a unique 
experience, wondering if there was any end to the madness. :)


AV-26 - Dark Dome
-----------------
This was the first level I ever recorded a max run for, and it remains 
to be my favorite map from Alien Vendetta.  It's a tough map to learn, 
but the possibilities for routes here seem endless.  However, once you 
know where the important rocket/cell caches are, as well as when to use 
the 3 invulnerabilities, you can slowly eat away at the hordes of 
monsters that roam the central part of this map.  It's easy to get nervous 
late in this map, after accomplishing so much, but it's also what 
appealed to me and developed my fondness for maps with tons of monsters for 
max play.


AV-27 - Stench of Evil
----------------------
A long and linear map, where conservation of ammo is important.  This 
map was problematic, as I was told 100% secrets sometimes didn't happen 
here when the map was played during beta testing.  We think the culprit 
was very thin secret sectors, so I ran over each sector a few times 
just to be on the safe side.  It looks silly, but hey, what else did you 
expect from me. :)


AV-28 - Whispering Shadows
--------------------------
Similar to map 27, this one is long and linear, and you have to take 
good care of your ammunition.  The cyberdemon battles are the focus of 
this map, since they are placed in some tricky locales.  The last one in 
particular can really get the blood pumping, his lair is very dark and 
very small.  Nice level name, too. :)


AV-29 - Fire Walk With Me
-------------------------
What a beautiful map! I love it. The most dificult part is 
the room with Skeletons. But Anders was so kind, that he put
it at the start. The room with hanged Imps made me really 
laugh (thx Anders).


AV-30 - Dreadful
----------------

AV-31 - Killer Colours
----------------------
[none received]


AV-32 - No Guts No Glory
------------------------
Special thanks to Vile for being the first to try out the route shown in 
this demo. Had some attempts here to bring it below 4 mins. Takes a bit 
of luck, and thus gets old really fast. One can have better goes which 
just decide to turn out slower cus of shitty infights.
