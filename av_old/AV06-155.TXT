As I watched this map for the first time a thought "This could be fun for
speedrunung", when I actually started to play it I realized that I was 
completly right, even more. Hope there is some other maps interesting in 
this cat.
Anyway hope you'll like the demo.

Ps. I just saw Vile's demo. Add, I never saw it before, I was working on my own route here based on what I saw in Ethh's demo.
