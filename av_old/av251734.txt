Description:

I played Demonic Hordes (map 25 in 2nd release of AV) for 15 years of 
doom on youtube, though it was very far from the Compet-N record. I 
just played my favorite map on a doom's birth day. I therefore wanted 
to try this map on this AV playthrough in youtube instead. This map as 
a whole was hard. Some areas in the first half which have a lot of 
chaingunners were so dangerous and I often died there. Also, although 
it was difficult to reach the latter half itself (huge valley areas), 
the part was far harder. The route was based on stx-Vile's route in 
the AV demopack, but I got BFG earlier and used it to a group of 
revenants and the mastermind. Moreover, I made two cyberdemons fight 
against other enemies in the 1st valley area after a yellow key's 
switch, and I left them and went to the 2nd valley area. As a result, 
almost all the mancubi which were so tricky were killed by them. This 
run is still slow in some parts, but below 20 min is OK.
