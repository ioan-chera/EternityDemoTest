  Description:	
  
  A huge map, the largest I ever played. I think it could've 
  been more fun if Kim had put some more cells here and there,
  but it's just my opinion. Coz it's mostly SSG action all the
  way to exit and that's boring sometimes. I played the hill
  a safe way, didn't want to die there again. I'm sure it's 
  possible to push it down under 20mins, but I have no idea at
  the moment what to speed up.
