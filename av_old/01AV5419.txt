Map 01 - Sunset:
----------------
I developed a tactic of shooting the pistol before picking up the shotgun 
to wake the enemies. Usually you can round the corner towards the first
door and get two (and sometimes three) enemies in one shot. I'm not sure 
if it really makes a difference time-wise either way. I could have used
better running skills and luck in the first 2/3 of this demo. Honestly
though, I'm pretty happy with a 1:18.

Map 02 - Rusty Rage:
--------------------
One cool thing that happened here was the chaingunner started an infight
with the imps while I was waiting on the lift. It happens every so often
(didn't happen in Anders demo though :P) and helps with the time. Another
thing I did differently then Anders (besides run fast, heh) is jump the 
gap between the red key and rocket launcher platform instead of back-tracking
through the caves. Again, I'm not exactly sure which route is faster. 
Make or break moments recording in this map include the imp cages and 
the archvile. I managed the cages fine but the archvile scene got messy.

Map 03 - Cargo Depot
--------------------
There's too many spectres in the blue key area. Really slows the action down.

Map 04 - Seclution
-----------------
About as fast as I can go here.

Map 05 - Crimson Tide
--------------------
The keys seem harder to grab then usual. Anders?

Map 06 - Hillside Siege
----------------------
Slow! gah. Target time here is a 8:30 and usually I can get a 8:15. Lost 
time when I got gang-banged by a crew of Revanants and ran away like a
little girl with 2% health. Two wasted bfg shots here also. As you'll
see that really hurts later on - this is a stock up level. Nothing like
getting your arse kicked on your home court. :~(

Map 07 - Showdown
----------------
I usually have enough cells to take care of all the mancubi. If I didn't
screw up map06 badly...

Map 08 - Beast Island
--------------------
Time says "10:18". Should read "Time sucks!". Botched this one badly.
Again, the cells I waste in map06 hurts me - VS. the archie I normally
bfg him. Here, I look like a trigger-happy blind man with a rocket 
launcher. I missed a late teleporting imp and knew it so I had to 
return to the top of the waterfall. I fell off the castle ledge
twice and faced the cyber pretty cowardly with the bfg. Make sure you
get the shell boxes at the beginning - even if you start the level with
50 shells you can find yourself running out later on.

Map 09 - Castle Gardens
-----------------------
If your wondering why I start shooting at nothing and return to areas I
already cleared it's because I'm paranoid about not getting 100%/100%.
It started in map08 and continues on until map10 exit. That soulsphere 
secret can really be a bitch to get. 

Map 10 - Toxic Touch
--------------------
Ten map episode run, map 10, in 10:00 minutes. Works for me. :-)
300 shells and 18 rockets to unload is great fun although I didn't
really plan how to use it effectively. That's not even considering
the ammo in the level. 

=======================================================================================

Description:
		This is my first movie. I'm not sure why I chose AV for a first movie
	attempt. Not good in hindsight, heh. AV is a great wad for sure but I really
	did struggle to get a complete 100/100 recording. I started archiving my 
	serious attempts (usually to level 06 or later). So I can date my first serious
	attempt back to September 10. After I recorded 30 "serious attempts" (file
	listing in my dir goes from 01av0001 to 01av0033) I got fed up and stopped 
	keeping most attempts. I figure most of these were at least 30 minutes in
	length (the 33 demos are 7.64mb total).

		AV episode 1 is my favorite of the three (plus ep 2 + 3 start off with
	some enormous maps). Sunset as map01 is your typical starter map. I was pretty
	fed up with this map though. The design is not very considerate of a speedrunner.
	Rusty Rage is one of Anders handful of great maps in ep1. It's unadulterated fast
	paced action. Small nuances include the imp cages, tree sprite placement, and the
	red-key exit door not staying open (grr :). Very fun tho. Usually if I can clear
	maps 01 + 02 without dieing or quitting because of the time I'm good to go until
	I reach map06. Maps 03 + 04 are Berggren treats. They're fun but it's pretty hard
	to die with the excessive health. Just a few too many medkits. =)

		Crimson Tide, map 05, starts off the second part of episode 1. It's a
	very solid gameplay map. Straight on to map 06. Hmm, what to say of map 06? I
	died the most in Hillside Siege. Yes, my own (co)map. =) It's got excellent
	architecture (Thanks Lee!), excellent monster placement (Thanks Anthony! [your 
	welcome!]), and excellent gameplay balance (Thanks Anders!). Map 07 was a 
	pleasant suprise. (Suprise, suprise Anders made it). Smooth, quick gameplay.
	Map 08 is a beast. I'm going to slap whoever put a thin-sector secret for the
	soulsphere secret. 1000 whip lashes to you. Also, 1000 whip lashes to Kim Malde
	for that soulsphere secret in map09. My fat arse couldn't fit in that 64x64 hole. heh.
	Map 10 is a solid finish. I got 99% kills here twice. The demon ambush in the plasma
	room was a poorely constructed teleporter - with the bfg it's possible to overlook
	a monster.

		I want to thank Doug for his movie of The Darkening Episode 2. That was what
	got me interested in doing a movie. I enjoyed watching that movie also. I want to 
	thank Radek Pecka for inspiration. Today we talked about AV episode 1 in IRC and it
	inspired me to record. (I can't wait to see you or stx-Vile record this!). I want to
	thank Altima for mocking my cyberdemon skills (sorry I don't sit at home strafing
	cybers in Grosse trying to punch them out on a 14" monitor - hehe j/k). Finally, I 
	want to thank the designers of episode 1: Martin Aalen Hunsager, Anders Johnsen, 
	Mattias Berggren, Lee Szymanski, Jan Endre Jansen, and Kim Malde. Excellent maps!

Woohoo!
