
 Alien Vendetta - Level 26: Dark Dome - NightMare! speed 3:58

 Description: This time seems a little slow, considering I had a trick jump to the
              red key at my disposal (special thanks to Cameron Prosser for his UV
              run demonstrating this trick :) but when this appeared to be possible,
              I felt compelled to try it.  I use all 3 invincibilities to go for ALL
              3 keys in this run.. but do I make it out alive? ;)
