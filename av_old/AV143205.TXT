map14 max 32:05

pathetically slow.... but at least it shows the level.
with something other than cowardly playing and a bit more map knowledge, this could be under 10 minutes without much trouble.
I bet I could drop it to 18 or so with a better effort.

I think the Megasphere was supposed to be an archvile jump, not strafe50 btw...
