 Description: I did this run three times successfully, scrapping the first two demos for
              different reasons:
              
              1. With a time a little over 30 minutes, this demo showed me running
                 around not knowing exactly where to go.  After learning the level
                 better, I produced a second run.

              2. This run is only slightly slower than the included run, but after
                 viewing the run in prboom with iddt I noticed that I missed some monsters
                 that teleported late into the blue key room; hence, it was not a true max
                 demo, which kinda sucked :).

              3. The included run, which shows my ideal strategy for this map.
                 I double-checked the main area and the blue key room to make sure
                 I didn't miss anyone.

              This map was pretty fun to play, and as said, it isn't as hard as it
              first appears.  You just need to know where to rearm and how to gradually
              eat away at the masses of monsters running around the central area.  Thanks
              to Anders Johnsen for making this cool map. :)
