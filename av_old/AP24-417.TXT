Heh, this is a truly horrible run, lots of time lost...just a proof demo
really. Got stuck in a weird way at the red pulsing corridor, completely
fucked up the slide, and forgot where the red key building was at the end :).
Still happy to have finished this run. Also included are two bonus demos -
world_cybie_convention.lmp shows the Cyberdemons having their annual
convention in the corridor where barons hide at first...*NOT* where you want
to see three of them together :). av24trik.lmp shows a trick i discovered
entirely accidentally while getting biffed around by cybie rockets in the
corridors behind yellow door...dunno if this is useful to anyone.
