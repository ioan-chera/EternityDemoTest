Description             : This megawad is compiled out of the first maps I made. I was still learning,
			so while the first maps may be noobish and simple (but still not really bad),
			the later ones get better and better as you progress. 100th wave includes new
			graphics, some of which you've never seen before (some work from scratch and
			some resources from the internet, but no CC4 or Nick Baker). An OBLIGATORY deh
			patch grants new storyline and two new enemies. 

			The first commercial trip to Phobos was a great success. However, the second one
			has to be put on hold due to Hellspawn attack. Rich tourists hate waiting, so get
			rid of the problem ASAP! And find out more playing 100th wave.
