==============================================

Excellent map!! My favourite from the orinal plutonia was MAP23, but this one
(inspired by MAP23) is way better, and it became obvious for me after playing
Plutonia's MAP23 once again.

Now, onto the Max demo strategies. We should consider:

1) Weapons. Chaingun and berserk are hardly ever used. The weapons which count
are: SSG, RL and BFG. One would want to try to get the BFG as soon as possible:
wrong! Even if we ignore the fact that the "three skull switches route" is
awkward, there are simply not enough cells to use the BFG everywhere. Both SSG
and RL are near the start, so there is no problem with these.

2) Armors. There are 2 blue armors very near the starting point. I believe they
are quite a necessity, so one must either go northeast or west through the door.

3) Backpacks - quite useful. If one goes northeast, there is a backpack in the
secret marked by a lightning. Otherwise, there is another one near the mancubus
guarding the switch.

4) Blur spheres - there are 2 of them, I believe. I think one MUST be used near
the corridor full of seargants. The second one, near the YK, proves useful
against of hordes of monsters which teleport in.

5) "x" monsters. We cannot predict the behaviour of a few floating monsters. One
pain elemental is the most important "unknown quantity".

Putting all of these into the equation resulted in the beginning of my route. I
take the backpack near the mancubus, awaken some monsters and then head west. I
pick up the blur sphere and the armor. When killing the arch-vile, some monsters
down below should begin to fight to each other. Soon afterwards I have the YK and
the RL, in other words: pretty much everything I need. The rest is complicated,
I try beating this map "counter-clockwise", not run out of rockets etc.

Of course, while my route seems perfectly logical, I am pretty sure there are
many more equally good or better routes which can be justified the same way.

I had 16:51 and then numerous sub-16 with missing monsters (some were my fault,
some were the designers's fault: monsters not teleporting in). This is my first
sub-15 and, unbelievably for me, all the monsters were killed.

I am not at satisfied with this ugly demo :( Almost all the arch-viles did nasty
things to me. My favourite moment was at 4:09 - I press '4' (wanted to kill 2
chaingunners with the chaingun to save rockets). Suddenly, the PE mentioned in 5)
appears. Pure luck to have the chaingun ready!
