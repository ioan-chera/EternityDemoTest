Comments:
my collection of uv-fast demos for the 33 maps of plutonia 2. The archive contains by the way only 32 uv-fast records (most maps weren't challenged before) instead of 33. Reason? the shortest map gave me really headaches: map30. I always hated the rocket-in-the-hole-games and I decided to stop wasting my time with that level, and post a failure demo of it instead :P

very important note: I began my very first experiences under this category with those videos, so it might be natural to see a slight improvement with the levels raising. In other words, some of the early demos are slow, and my playing may look quite unconfident. It often was. I probably can beat most of those demos here easily now. This project started almost 2 years ago, and took so long due to my often lack of time and quits (mostly due to work, and other games I spent time with).
I for sure will continue recording under uv-max and uv-fast in the next times. Hope you enjoy the videos, some levels were (imho) absolutely not tought for this category and were really hard.

All the demos are/will be uploaded on my youtube channel, with a proper description each time.
