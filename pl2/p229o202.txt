I wanted to get sub 2 mins, but not THAT bad since with a better route you could beat it on first exit anyway. One obvious improvement would be going straight for the red key and gliding past the pillars. As an aside, I thought you needed red key to lower those pillars. Wouldn't surprise me if there was some crazy magic trick for skipping the entire level with a godlike rocket jump. How I ended up landing where I did after the drop to "hell" I have no idea.
