Description:

Nice arranged Go 2 It! Moreover, the sense of adding Doom E1M1
and Dwango 5 map 1 is wonderful. This demo is slow run, but 
the forcing breakthrough on this map is really difficult.
I was annoying with a lot of teleporting Arch-Viles after
getting the blue key. I understand that it is not optimal
for speedrunning to finish the map by pushing the switch. 
However, I prefer it.
