I'm sorry I have to beat the former record with a demo that has kind of a cruddy ending, but I got super lucky with the south glide in this demo, and the
north one happened around usual, so I was done with both glides a few seconds before my past attempts. I tried for a while to get 51s, but I just didn't get
lucky enough to get the south glide so quickly again (and whenever I tried to force the north glide to be faster, inevitably, is when I'd mess it up and go
too far). Maybe I'll come back to this in the future if I feel so inclined.

Other than the luck factor, this isn't too hard. South guidless glides aren't hard to do, and neither are north ones imo; you just have to be very careful
and move the mouse forward slowly. Here, you can just tap the wall after the south glide to go a little left, so when you turn 180º, you can be set up for
the north glide and only worry about getting the glide.

I included a demo where I got a bizarre thing to happen while I was trying to glide south. Obviously, that demo wouldn't have been a keeper, even if I hadn't
overshot the north glide (you can tell by nudging the strafe right key, and the corner will get you stuck if you're too far left). It's kinda funny to see
my reaction to the unusual south glide.
