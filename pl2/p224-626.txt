Description:

This map is much easier as compared with map 21, 22, and 23. 
However, I was often killed by the cyber when I got the RL, and 
I was often killed by teleported enemies after I pushed the switch 
for the blue key. Their parts are a little unfair, so I don't like 
them. Excluding them, this map is no problem. At first, I used a 
standard way and got 7:11, but I wasn't satisfied that I finished 
this map with keeping about 20 rockets. You can get 24 rockets in 
the last part, but you can't use them well if the remainder of monster 
are only the cyber demon and a revenant in the exit room. Therefore, 
I ignored enemies which were encountered in the start area after I 
got the blue key, then I killed them in the last part. If you use 
this route, this map is a little harder because you can't get a soul 
sphere. As a result, I got this not-so-bad record.
