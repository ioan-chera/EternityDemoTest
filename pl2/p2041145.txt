==============================================

There is a cool trick here at the end which allows a quick annihilation of the mancubi.
Now I guess further time improvements are possible, maybe even getting below 10:00!
One must:
- have the arachnotron vs chaingunners infighting with the arachnotron dead,
- have more luck with the pain elementals,
- have more health, so that riding up the lift to collect medikit+armor bonuses
  is not needed,
- play more aggresively against baron/hell knights/revenants.
