  Description:
  An older -nomo run I made to test the linedef jump in the doorway where berserk is. Didn't
  bother with avoiding the revenants trigger for obvious reasons. Also missing a ridiculously
  hard RJ across the moat, from the window of the fort on the way back from blue key. Saves
  whopping ~2sec. :)
