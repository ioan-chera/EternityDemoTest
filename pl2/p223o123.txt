Hmm, I think in nomonsters you just have to go the traditional route.
There's no super cool arch-vile jump to the switch which lowers the yellow
skull posts. :)

I didn't spend too much time on this (was too lazy to try to work down
the .31), so it should be improvable.

I hope this serves as a demo to get somebody started on making a nice run
for this map... at least with this route. There may be better in nomonsters,
but I am not currently aware of any.
