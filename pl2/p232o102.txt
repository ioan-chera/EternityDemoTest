Woohoo, I got this in like 10 tries. :D I'm surprised that I got a
decent demo right away. You even see me pause for a brief couple tics at
the glide because I really expected not to get it that quickly. I used
to be so bad at gliding... :)

This just shows that even if you think you're not going to be good at
something, just keep doing it if you like it, and you will get better over
time. :)

Also, interesting SR50 jump at the beginning. It seems only to work if
(or iff as we mathemiticians like to say :D) when you run on that one 
platform before the RSK, you must run so that you pass on one sticking-out
part, go across air, then run on the farther sticking-out part, then onto 
the thing which "keeps you from" the red key.

It would be awesome to see 59, but I don't know if I can get it. Maybe
someone better skilled and who has more patience than I will get 59. :)
