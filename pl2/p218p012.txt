  Description:

  What jongo did, without hurting monsters. 11 is quite possible, but it's painful to try.
  Most of my runs ended because:
  a) I skip the linedef opening the first bars. Sliding the zombies makes it even worse.
  b) I fail at opening the yellow bars fast enough. They are so tiny :(
