Demo entry #169.

Description:

The revenant is a heavily underhated monster. Bloody good RNG is necessary to
avoid getting blasted by their missiles, unless you are playing this Nightmare
run at a more casual pace :)

Took 1462 tries to get 2 exits (first was 3:59 on my 508th attempt). I didn't
bother with any shortcut glitches in the second half -- instead, I decided to
rush past the cyborg and a few other heaps of flesh. My performance is still
shaky in early parts, but the later scenes made up for it.

Credits to Red-XIII for his segmented demo, dew and 4shockblast for the UV
speedruns and Thomas van der Velden for this extremely memorable map, superb
from beginning to end.
