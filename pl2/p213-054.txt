  Description:

  Whew, this took a while. I managed 1:40ish with both armor
  and sphere and loads of health left so I skipped one of them.
  Armor seemed more important and convenient, there's just too
  many monsters around the sphere, not mentioning unfavorable
  piggies migration behind the blue bars that followed.
  And a quartet of unkilled imps spamming from the balcony.
  
  Health conservation was a bitch, SSG is meant for the baron,
  I couldn't complete the AV jump with him on my back. The jump
  itself is also a bit harder than usual. I guess I lucked out,
  because archie bestowed me with his precious attention and
  chainies ignored me. Usually it's the other way around :)

  First exit on this route, btw.
