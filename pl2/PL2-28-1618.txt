Comments:

This is my favourite map in Plutonia 2, I do really like the design of this map, it was so beautiful, especially
the bloodwall outside! The remixed "Gut Wrencher" music from Duke Nukem 3D suits this map well, there's lots of
interesting and surprising fights also.

This map is not too hard if you are used to it, but it contains lots of traps, and these traps are mostly based
on revenants or chaingunners. The 1st plasma gun trap is dangerous, you may get killed easily if you don't run
fast. Another dangerous trap is outside the bloodwall, which you press a switch and release some chaingunners and
teleporting revenants. I may thought that using the plasma gun more at the 1st halve may done it faster and safer,
indeed it works!

The dangerous traps are not the hardest part of this map, indeed the most tricky part is the large cyberdemon
battle at the southern large hall. You release 2 cyberdemons, then you press a switch and release 2 archviles as
well as some barons. It's not a large problem by leding infighting between them, but there's a chance archviles
may change targets to you. When you press a switch at the southern part of the large hall, many revenants may 
released out, followed by mancubus, demons and cacodemons after press another switch at both end. Another 2 nasty
traps are waiting for you, you press the switch above the hall, many nasty monsters released around you, you need
to be very careful! This large battle need to be deal carefully, beware of revenants and cyberdemons missiles, but
it's a great fun to me. :D

The final part is not too hard, but need to keep enough health since 3 revenants will wait for you at the end of
the invisible bridge. After all these, going to the exit may not be a problem.

I included 2 lmp files here, which shows one failed demo and a Invalid UV Max demo with a ghost demon seen. The 
time done between 13:00 to 17:00 is reasonable, below 15 minutes is possible.
