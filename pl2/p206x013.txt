TAS features used: Permanent SR-50/SR-50 turns and slow motion (50%).

Just a fun little TAS demo for kicks, made in a couple of hours.  I turned down the mouse sensitivity (I normally use a very high setting), but it still came out like crap.

I don't know how some people can make smooth TAS demos, but unless one is a masochist who enjoys dizzy spells, please watch with "Smooth Demo Playback."  

12 seconds MIGHT be possible, but would require some seriously precise movements.
