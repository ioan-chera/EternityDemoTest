==============================================

While Fredrik's contibution to PL2 may be overshadowed by Gusta's work,
it cannot be ignored. The so-often-criticized "Filth" (MAP04) is a decent
map. Sure, I disliked it first, but during my Tyson recordings I began to
appreciate it - IMO that map captures the Plutonia Experiment style
perfectly! But let's forget about MAP04 for a while, here's MAP13, which
belongs to my private Top 6 of PL2!! But, you know, I am a Vrack3 fan,
and this is very Vrackish, trust me. The layout (reminiscent of Knee-Deep
also), the computer panels in the ceilings, barrel placement... you may not
believe me, but if I hadn't read the PL2 textfile nor intermission screens
and had to guess which map was created by Fredrik, I would undoubtly pick
this one.

The demo - I believe it is a bit better than my MAP17 Max. I am very proud
of skipping plasma rifle until the end, which is sort of counterintuitive
- normally in Max demos one gets all the weapons ASAP and the plasma rifle
detour is minimal. However, all those cells and that soulsphere as a bonus
are just perfect for the final battle. Yeah, I finished the map with too
much cell ammo, a slight mistake, but normally I shoot that arch-vile
with rockets, cells, and miss horribly, but not in this demo.

At the RK door I am cautious to "push" the cacodemons forward. If killed by
the door, you're guaranteed to have ghost monsters (a new Murphy Law).
The funny thing happened a bit later (funny for us, but not for the doomguy:
he was supposed to be invisible, yet EVERYONE hit him and his health dropped
from about 170% to about 30%).

Any takers for MAP18 Max?
