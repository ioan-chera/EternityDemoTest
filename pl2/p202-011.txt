Well, I'm not happy at all with the demo,
I had plenty of really good looking runs
that were low 12's. God doesn't exist.

This time I got the biggest load of luck,
it was my FIRST TRY of the day since I'm
trying this on and off for a while now,
I wasn't even warmed up and I screwed the
ending. BAH. I'm quite disgusted to be
rewarded like that for all my efforts but
anyway enjoy what there is to enjoy.
