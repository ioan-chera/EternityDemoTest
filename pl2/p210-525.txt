Comments:

It was time to improve one of my own old demos since skepticist showed
me that 6:44 isn't really a good time for this map and he did a 6:18 demo
with ease :)
Main problem in this map is to get true 100% kills, because sometimes
there were one or two damn cacos left behind in some sneaky corners.
I hated the last caco at the "lottery" lift and should've better used the
chaingun there, but I just didn't think, that it had so much health left.
Everything else went smooth or at least "ok" for me :)
