Description:

This map is very tough because there are some unfair traps.
If the arch-vile doesn't attack you soon after you get 
the red key, you can't give rockets to the vile well and 
are interfered by cacodemons. The yellow key's trap is 
also tricky. Some enemies prevent you avoiding Cyber's
missiles. This run is still slow. Especially, the latter 
part is very slow. I haven't yet spent much time and come 
up with any good strategy.

I included demos in which a bug happened. A mancubus fell 
into under the floor sometimes for some reasons. It made 
me get irritated a little.
