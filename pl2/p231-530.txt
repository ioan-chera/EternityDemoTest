  # Description:  #   Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I did it, I improved termrork's demo :)  #
  #################   I think that his route is not the same as mine old one, it is better#
  # because He decided to kill the cyberdemons when they are in six, so that you can kill #
  # them with 600 ammo of bfg. So, before starting talk about my demo, I'd like to thank  #
  # him, it's a really good route improvement :)  and thanks also because you showed us   #
  # how to broke 6 minute wall, and maybe 5 too :)					  # 
  # The beginning went fine, but unfortunately for me, the volume of my pc was low, so I  #
  # didn't hear the arch-vile dieing, and I wasted 10 seconds there ( also in the end )   #
  # The chaingunners' room was not good, after I was hit two times by that revenant, I was#
  # demoralized, and I thought that it was going bad. Then I continued to run, the arch   #
  # -vile near the bfg didn't teleport but that's ok, I killed him quickly and then...    #
  #  I wanted to kill myself, I waste 170 health for nothing, I was between an hell knight#
  # and a pig, I also stopped myself, deciding if I should have killed them with bfg to   #
  # avenge myself, ( have fun, it's the first thing ) but I decided to continue.          #
  # Then I killed the 6 cyberdemons, all of them without any ammo, so that was good, but  #
  # then I exploded my self to the pig, and put the pistol exept of SSG.  Oh, I also      #
  # missed the fake exit :) It's the last part, one cyber remain and the spidermastermind,#
  # I killed them pretty slowly, but I don't care. Maybe I should have killed the last    #
  # invisible pigs with bfg, but it's ok. You know, I'm pretty satisfied with this, also  #
  # because I had a good health in the end :) I think it's all.  Oh, error, please try to #
  # beat it, so that I can beat you again :))   BYYYYYY                    		  #
