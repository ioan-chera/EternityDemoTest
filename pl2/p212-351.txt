Took a break from my failures on CC MAP29, and decided to have a change of pace and record something else.  This demo was my first exit of the day, in under 20 minutes...lol.  Hope you'll enjoy this, Tenda.  :)

I think that having the slightly wider view and timer is a bit more useful than the ammunition counter, so this "regular information" HUD will be what I'm going to use from now on.

This is my final demo for this map, though I might try for a 3:4x in the far future.
