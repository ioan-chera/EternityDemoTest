  Description:

   I wanted to make a speedrun again and when I
   looked at the pl2.wad-records I was wondering why a 
   Map15s NM run is missing there...

   After several runs I made this one, it can be easily
   beaten, because of many mistakes...
   A different track would also save seconds :)
