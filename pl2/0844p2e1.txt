map01	Comeback
  Red was right, the grab is too hard to be useful. I made just one small change
  to the regular route: silent pacifist. It brings some entirely new pitfalls,
  but no teleporting reinforcements are so sweet. My avg is, sadly, around 37s.

map02	Jungle Spirits
  Ouch. I'm used to 3x sec exits here, but also to a lot of dying, being stuck
  on stupid skull sticks and other bullshit decorations. An unpredictable level.

map03	Skull Island
  Wow... such a smooth run shocked me. Best stuff in the demo. The grab can cause
  an annoying time loss, but the exit jump is a true life-or-death matter.
  (The bonus map10 death demo shows an useful trick when the jump goes wrong.)

map04	Filth
  I copied some of Red's safety measures to ease the route, but going for the BA
  was just stupid, I had everything I needed. Not very elegant, could've been
  under a minute, but keeping 75%+ health is far more important here.

map05	Flooded Chapel
  I pushed my luck, didn't I. :) I'm not comfortable with the sphere battle,
  so I rely on doing the AV jump the hard way.

map06	Collider Complex
  Arrrghhh... my worst enemy in the episode. The final AV jump was so unreliable
  for me, I had to take the bars down. A while before completing this run, I died
  there 3 times in 20 minutes, that's at least 9 failed AV jumps in a row. :(

map07	Enemy Caught
  Red is a genius, the aim-up button shot is the trick of the year for me easily.
  A trivial level with the BFG, although the manco fight is very sloppy.

map08	Harmany
  This is usually the easiest map for me, but I, erm, was too fat on the ledge. :p

map09	Wormhole Zone
  I'm going to pretend this didn't happen at all. All prboom+ users should kindly
  press the pgdown key at this point...

map10	Cosmodrome
  I already died on map10 once and I almost did it again. This time I kept my cell
  reserve, but I still botched the platform room very, very badly. Special mention
  for an unnecessary ssg shot in the ship area that got punished deservingly.


  Finally, I was getting a little crazy from this. :) My 1st 10exit, of course.
  I started toying with pl2e1 at the end of August, but nothing really serious.
  Then Red-XIII stunned me with his pioneer ep runs and suddenly I had to get down
  to business. As Red mentioned, the strategy is basically: rewatch my TAS movie,
  train the tricks, forget the dangerous ones and start grinding. And breathe deep
  and count to ten every time you die in map06.

  Red: Thanks for some ideas, feel free to copy some of mine and improve. :)
