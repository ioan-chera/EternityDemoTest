  Description:

  This started at horrible, not very speedy times and still
  looks sadly unoptimized. I really suck at these sweep type
  runs, especially when trying to act all aggressive. :)
  Still, I'm happy I grinded <3 mins, so I'll stop for now.

  The route is pretty tight on ammo, especially the first
  part. That return to spawn platform is self-explanatory.
  Cacos and chainies simply owned me too much when I rushed
  to the final area. Skipping YSK is a no-brainer. The glide
  is wall-aligned ergo fast and I prefer wasting some time
  on positioning than facing all those revenants that teleport
  in. East side has a friendlier set of enemies so I actually
  carry that blue armor to the final area. West side usually
  ended with losing all the green armor+soulsphere gain.

  The final area consists of killing all the fast shooting
  monsters and any remaining cacos. And then the main dish.
  That exit glide is fun, fun, fun! Nothing motivates your
  speed like an army of revenants closing in fast. :)

  Oh and I tried wallrunning on monsters to jump over the bars,
  RJ to the bars button, shooting the archie down so he would
  follow me and throw me to the button... no chance, Lance.
