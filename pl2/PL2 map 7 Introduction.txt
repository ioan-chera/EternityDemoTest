This is one of the most famous map in PL2, as well as the map which doomers like to chanllenge at, it's also one
of my favourite map in PL2. Just like many map 7 in other wads, it always give you a dead simple feeling.

A hard start, not because of the mancubus and cacodemon hordes, the point is the revenants. They will shoot you in
all directions, and you nearly got nowhere to hide too. After all mancubus get killed, I think most doomers know
what happens, the spiders right? Oh yeah! Those spiders are not easy to deal with, unless you kill them one by one
under the cliff with a SSG. I try to kill the monsters in the upper citadel as fast as possible to save more time.

The later parts are easy, but I got a lot of silly mistakes. First by being hit several times by teleporting hell
knights, then is the final part. I don't know what the purpose of me standing not moving, I get hit by green flames
and nearly get killed. :(

This is my best run, under 6 minutes is OK.
