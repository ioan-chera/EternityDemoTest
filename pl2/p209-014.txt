  Description:

  Gotta love Gusta's levels, there's so much going on from the first tick.
  The run might have been a tiny bit smoother, SSG grab looks redundant,
  but I suck at killing things with SG and my brain is straining too much
  from counting to five. :)
  This route might work pacifist-style, too, I'd love to see someone
  tiptoeing around that chaingun dude.
