  Description:

  Thanks for the hint, Gusta. Awesome hard jump. :)
  It took me a while to realize I don't need the RK to raise the first half of the bridge,
  after that I started surviving the bridge massacre. Archie was a bit dumb and my movement
  in the spider chamber is embarrassing, but whatever. You don't get picky on 1st exit,
  especially when you eat so much damage as I did.
  I was completely hypnotized by that HK's spit... :)
