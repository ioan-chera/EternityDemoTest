Ok, finally a recording that isn't a complete disaster. First of, after I took the blue armor I got distrcated with an ICQ message so my play is screwed up as is very evident there heh. I don't usually try to save much health there anyway as I seldom suceed so no biggie. I never figured out how the handle the big room and in this run the impossible happened. I got to the switch very early and survived. I pretty ran my standard known route and had to improvise after I realised I won't have enough ammo to deal with everything the way I'm used to. So time lost as I try to figure things out. The hit I took opening the yellow door was everything but fair, didn't see that coming.:D At one point I thought I'm dead, but somehow survived. The end went ok, well maybe except the missed exit, that was more becasue I didn't believe I finished and was expecting a Cacoball or something to hit me in the face. Overall could be much better but I'm not complaining. Lots of room for improvement but as this run doesn't suck completely I'll share.:)
