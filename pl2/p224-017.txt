  Description:
  I did 17 in my 30p2 TAS, so this is a proof of how much some of the e3 runs suck in it. :)
  It's the old TGH's route, but I rely on the longshot the imps will let me on the platform
  AND press the button with just the pistol. It can go even smoother, but ehh... it takes
  dronish grinding just to get past that spot. Then it's play time with the revenant, which
  isn't usually as easy as I got it here. And finally, the cybie just has to be in a good mood.
  The manco is dumb, but it's completely random if the cybie blasts my guts over the walls
  or not. Sooo... 16 optimum? Not by me though, that's a given.
