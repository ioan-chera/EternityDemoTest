  Description:

  This only took an hour & half...
  Honestly this is my first exit, knowing that I'll need an optimised
  demo to beat Guiddqd's 12s, I quit whenever I didn't have perfect running
  I used SR50 for the jump to save time which made me fall to the other side
  about 5 times before in previous tries, luckily this time a chaingunner
  blocked me from falling and while running to exit, I was wishing for 11,
  and it happened =D
  I'm happy this turned out reality too ^_^
