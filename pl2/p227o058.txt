I thought it would be possible to somehow grab the yellow key with a single glide but I couldn't do it without going through the bars and then having to glide back. So I just did things the traditional way instead since while north to south glides aren't too bad (this one felt particularly easy for some reason) south to north is a whole another thing. No super fancy movement or tricks but hey, one more demo for the pack no one seemed to want to do.
