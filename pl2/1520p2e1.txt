  #Description# Hey there :) Finally!!! This is the second time I end this episode in Uv speed; I did this some months ago but there was a recording error so I lost the demo
( argh you can't imagine how angry I was )  Anyway, I finally did it again and 18 seconds faster than my last time :) 
The first Idea of doing this came when I saw for the 100 times the plutonia2 all tas made by dew, then  I started studying the levels and all the goods routes, and I'm very glad of how it turned out, even if some levels could definitely be done better.

Level 01: A normal start, my time was always like this so it's ok.
          I prefered a safe route instead of spped route.

Level 02: Not bad, far from a good run but it's ok. The boring part is take the blue armor but you need it;
          many times the remnants block you.

Level 03: There it is!! The worst run of the demo, I can't believe it!! More than a minute to grab that damn blue key!
          I also thought to quit because it was a totally crap, even the last part!
          The final jump only happened just 3 times but that can save more than 30 seconds!

Level 04: I like this level, but it can be a little frustating sometimes but not this time, it went good (exspecially               the immortal knight :P ). 

Level 05: An easy level if the arc cooperate good, not like this time but I'm ok with this.


Level 06: Probably my favourite level of episode 1 with level 07. I really like this level and I always enjoy doing this,
          also I never died in this level. But it could be done better, I didn't jumped good with arc so I needed                   another medikit (maby not) but still is ok.

Level 07: Best run of the demo. I love bfg. All said :)))

Level 08: I suck!!! I always hated the jump trought the ledge. And I also confused red door with yellow door, oh man I'm           a crap, it won't be a placeful sight :(

Level 09: Not good as I hoped, I've been disturbed by monsters.
 
Level 10: Last level of the run, didn't went good. Damn that ledge jump.
          I wasted timed killing the arc in the blue key part. Maby I didn't have to kill him but I died there one time 
          so I wanted to be safe this time.
  
  Well, In the end I'm pretty satisfied with this  ( not 03 and 08 ) but this can be definitely be improved, my best times are a lot better than this one so under 10 minute is my goal for now :)
  SEE YA!!!
