Description: This run is insane!!
	     As with MAP14, I wanted to make a TAS out of this, but I looked into some UV Speed runs and thought that it might be possible to do this in real time.

	     Beginning is easy up to point where the two Hell Knights are guarding the door, getting past them is quite difficult.
	     Next is the archvile jump, they are usually fast with their attacks, but other monsters may interrupt the 'jump'.
	     After pressing the switch, what comes after the teleporter is just absolute chaos, this was actually the second run that got past the mancubus, with many attempts dying there.
	     The part after that is just straight-up running and praying for the least damage possible. By some miracle I survived the vile's attack and the spectre wasn't asshole either.
