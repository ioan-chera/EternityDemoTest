  #Description# YES!!! Finally I made also episode 2 of plutonia2. I started this some   ############# months ago and I usually play it together with episode1 but I always died at level14 and last week at 15. But today (yesterday I recorded it) I did it, I never arrived over level 15 so I didn't know what to do :) 
Well, if we compare the time with the tas episode 2, this "run" may look like a crap but I'm very happy of finishing this. Of course there were some levels that went really bad, like 14 and 18, exspecially 18. Anyway lets start with level description. 

Level 11: A strange beginning for this episode. Since I needed bfg, I had to kill all             the arcs but fortunately it went good. The last room is a bit frustating                because you can exit with over 15% of health but usually you exit at 1% so              you need to be very careful on the beginning of the next level
          
Level 12: I like this level altought the beginning can be frustating but everything           went fine. In a normal UV speed this level is hard because you don't have bfg           to kill all the monsters in the rl part. Ah, I love bfg! :)

Level 13: Another frustating level; you don't have many chances to try that jump and           the monsters can be really annoying, like this time.

Level 14: Ahh,there it is, the second worse run of the episode. I always died here in           all my attempts so this time I didn't care about the time and I killed almost           all the monsters. I also finished the ssg ammo so I was a bit confused at the           end.

Level 15: I totally got mad in this level I don't know how I did it, I could do it very           faster.

Level 16: Ah, the easiest run of the episode; I never got worried for this level           because with a green sphere and a soul sphere everything will go fine

Level 17: I like this level but I needed to kill the monsters because they can be           really annoying during the glide.

Level 18: Here it is, the worse run ever! I could never think that this coulb be that           hard I almost died 4-5 times. This time is definitely bad, even if you have           to kill some monsters, under 3 minutes should be a good run

Level 19: A normal run, I'm quite good with this considering how I hate/love this jump.
 
Level 20: The hardest level of the run and one of the hardest keve of pl2. I was           totally destroyed after taking the blue key, all against me. I was saved by           the soul sphere. The yellow key part, well, you need to be patient because I           continued only when all the monsters were killed, I couldn't risk. I also was           really scared by the final jump but incredibily it went good. You can't           imagine how happy I was while exiting :))) 

Well, overall I enjoed doing the episode2, more than episode1 so I'll definitely try this again, 28 minutes is too much for an episode, I'd like to go under 20 minutes.
Now only episode3 miss, mhhh, I think I'll begin studying the levels and routes :)
SEE YA
