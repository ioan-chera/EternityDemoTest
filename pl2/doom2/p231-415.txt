  # Description:  #  Hey guys :) first thing to say..   YEAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA             #
  #################  First time I ended this great, insane, hard level :) it'a almost #
  # near to UV max, so maby I'll try it :)                                            #  
  # The beginning went really weird, that's the first time I missed the SSG, but who  #
  # cares? :) The second part was quite good, I was lucky that one cyber stayed       #
  # stucked because he was attacked by a revenant which didn't come out of the door.  #
  # The last part, after I killed the last arc-vile, my hands were shaking, but I     #
  # already planned to go getting the soulsphere, ( I didn't know if was better take  #
  # the megasphere first ) After pushing the last 2 buttons, my plan was to go        #
  # straight to the exit, but I lost myself :)))  probably the emotion:)              #
  # In the end, I think that this was my best strategy run, I never did something     #
  # hard like that, so I'm really proud of this and I'll defende this one :)          #
  # Oh, I forgot, I've been trying this since september, but I always died when there #
  # were 4 cyber out there :) Last week I arrived for the first time to the false     #
  # exit, but the spidermastermind killed me.                                         #
  # You know what? I'm really stupid :) today it was the first day I discovered that  #
  # there is a megasphere on this level, and I have to thank that megasphere, because #
  # without it, I'd never write this TXT :)                                           #
  # Well, that's it :)))                                                              #
  # See Ya folks :)                                                                   #
