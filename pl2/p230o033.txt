It did take me several weeks to figure out how to manipulate IOS into spawning a vile every time, heh. In the end I printed out Doom's lookup table, fired up xdre and watched what shooting does to the LUT index pointer. Arch-voila!

For anyone seeking 32s: 8 continuously fired chaingun bullets and 1 pistol shot (a little dance is optional). I got bored of the grind.

Shoutout to Looper and dr.sean for giving me some helpful advice!
