  Description:

  Heh, I'm pretty sure the map isn't supposed to work this way.
  The bridge buttons trick is okay I guess, but I doubt I should
  be allowed to lower the blue exit bar without BK?!
  
  I noticed it during my first stroll through the map, because
  I had NO IDEA what to do, got lost, mashed some buttons and
  exited with just yellow key and wtf expression on my face :)
  Of course I didn't bother with exploring the rest of the map
  and I have no clue where BK actually is :)

  The run itself is decent but nothing special. I got a bit lucky
  that the baron and all the cacos were very gentlemanly and made
  me way up to the spider.
