  Description:

  The exit room is nowhere near as easy as it looks archies
  run around randomly, block you and often start summoning
  their flames together, so you don't survive the attack
  and lots of other shit happens.......

  BTW don't forget to check dew's 11s run for his epic looking exit :D
  Hope you liked the run :)
