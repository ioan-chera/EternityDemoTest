Hmm, this map is one of many that seems to lack a good shortcut when
playing with the -nomonsters parameter. Nevertheless, I really like this
map, and how the level progresses and seems different all the time
despite only a few textures/flats being used.

I thought I should try to record another demo for the demopack, and maybe
nobody else would want to do such a long map, so I figured I'd do it
since I like it so much. :)

However, I was lazy enough only to get the time below 2 minutes. With
better, less choppy running, and fewer wallbumps, this time can be better.
Maybe another, better route is possible?

In my defense though, it's hard to run smoothly with so many quick twists
and turns, and so many sticking-out walls make a run with no wallbumps
nearly impossible without TAS.
