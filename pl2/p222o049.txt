Nice map.. I really like the feel and atmosphere of this one. Cool bridge
jump shortcut also.. discovered it on my own the first time I played this
map (the trick was already up on DSDA, but I didn't know about it...
still, I sadly can't take credit for it ;P).

First, I got 52 (while still warming up). I figured I'd push it down to
below 50 somewhere al final. After a while, I got 50.89 but knew it 
could be run faster, so I got a few more 50's, and then I got 49 fairly
quickly after that.

I know it looks ugly when I go short on one jump, but I don't lose any 
time since I have to wait for the YSK platform to lower anyway (this was
after a switch). A bit of a bump at the end due to excitement, but I think
this demo is somewhat smooth. Should be easy enough to get 48 or maybe
lower anyway. :)

Enjoy!
