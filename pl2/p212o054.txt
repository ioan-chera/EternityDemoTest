First I got 0:58.
Then I got 0:57.
Then I got a bunch of 0:56's.
Then I got a bunch of 0:55's.
Then I got 0:54.

That being said, this is definitely not a perfect demo. Stupid wallbump
at the beginning makes this frustrating, but I don't think I can bring
this down another full second without screwing up elsewhere.

Oh well, the opportunity is open for anybody who wants to try for 0:53
or lower.
