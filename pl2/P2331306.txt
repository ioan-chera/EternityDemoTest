Note/Comment:
This may not be a "legal" MAX demo as of I do not know how to check
if any one Respawned and then got killed.
But any way, this is the first MAX* demo of p233 I know of, so this
is a "table filler" for the Doomworld Plutonia 2 demo Thread and is
vary beatable.

+ Since Final DOOMs Executable is is my DOOM2 directory DooM2.wad is
the iwad so the command goes like this "-file plutonia.was pl2.wad"

*A monster may have Respawned and then bean killed... I Don't know
how to check for some think like that so this may not be a "legal"
MAX run, if it is not pleas let me know at "ArchyQDOS@live.com" 
Thank you and happy holidays!
