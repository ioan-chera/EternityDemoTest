Description:


Decided to try some pl2 tysons and this came up first. A big bunch of ammo and berserk+chainsaw makes this level quite easy.
On balance there isn't that much health to go around so you have to be careful.
A stupid moment at 9:40 almost ends the run. I'm not sure what I was thinking. After that everything goes smoothly though.
