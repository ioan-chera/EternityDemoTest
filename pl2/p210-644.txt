Comments:

At least I'm satisfied with this, but it surely can be beaten though.
The most annoying thing is that damn "lottery" lift in the refueling station.
I probaly could have had more luck with monsters fighting each others,
but they just didn't give me that favour so I had to kill them myself,
wasting time indeed
