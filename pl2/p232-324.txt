Description:

Nice arranged Go 2 It! Moreover, the sense of adding Doom E1M1
and Dwango 5 map 1 is wonderful. The forcing breakthrough on
this map is really difficult. I was annoying with a lot of
teleporting Arch-Viles after getting the blue key. I improved
my old record for about 1 min, but my play is slow yet and
I lost some seconds by Arch-Viles' attack. I understand that
it is not optimal for speedrunning to finish the map by pushing
the switch. However, I prefer it.
