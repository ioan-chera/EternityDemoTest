  Description:
  My second exit (both today and ever). After almost a year of rushing this map too much,
  I started taking it seriously and planned my route to never run out of cells and rockets.
  Everything I wanted to do went okay, so I'm really content with this for a tablefiller. :)

  The killing might be a bit excessive at points, but I preferred safety over clock racing.
  Most of the map went surprisingly smooth, I usually choke somewhere for a long time, cause
  every step of this bitch of a map is dangerous. The end got pretty nervewrecking, the archies
  were stubborn and didn't want to let me exit alive.

  Sooo... the most epic UV-speed obstacle falls, finally. There's plenty to improve, but it's
  damn hard work if you're interested. I used a few time saving tricks here and there, nothing
  major though. And breaking 5 minutes is certainly a nice bonus.
