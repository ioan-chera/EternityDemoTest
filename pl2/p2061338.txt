Comments:

This is mainly to fill the gap in the dsda speedrun table. Though I'm quite
satisfied with this one, because I'm just an average player. It's a second
exit after something about 15+ that just wasn't worth to release.
It was kind of stressful and I lost my bearings from time to time as you
will see in some of the middle parts, containing resignation, too.
Most annoying thing should be the Mancubus tele-spamming in the final area.
Thx to dew for motivating me to continue PL2 max-runs :)
