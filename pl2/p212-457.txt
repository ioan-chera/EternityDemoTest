Comments:

Route credit goes to Nevan, who has the much better and cleaner demo.  Time sometimes isn't everything.

Thought the current record's time would be easy to beat due to the player I had not heard of (Nevan), but boy, was I wrong.  
This required quite a few hours of work, but I finally got it to under 5.

After I handled the yellow key area reasonably well, I got extremely nervous due to the fact that most of my attempts did not make it past the rocket launcher room. 
My hands started to shake, but thank goodness it did not affect my play too much, although my movement went from bad to atrocious.

As with any other demo I make, the time isn't optimal because of skill limitations.  
4:4x/4:3x are reasonable targets with better movement and shot selection/more infighting.
