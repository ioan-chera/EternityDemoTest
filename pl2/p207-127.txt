  Description:

  Seriously, c'mon guys. That glide was SO obvious!
  I knew about it, but I was leaving it to others,
  because I'm worthless on every map07 ever created.
  I wouldn't circle-strafe a stoned hippie cyberdemon
  on a football stadium. I had to take it slow and
  careful with SSG, surely there's someone who can
  speed it up with constant RL.
  Although I really lucked out on killing monsters
  in this one. It almost looks like a well-thought
  max run after I switched to RL. It was not. :)

  Btw, for some reason, the glide seems much easier
  without the -record parameter.
