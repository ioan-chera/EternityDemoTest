  Description:

  Oh wow. I can't believe how much utter bullshit this level lets me to pull off.
  I don't even know why I continued this run after getting butchered at the baron
  switch, this health usually means death by cacos or lava. I continued on mindless
  autopilot, cause the 'checkpoint times' were decent. That chainie at the first
  bridge switch usually isn't so hyperactive and it's the revenants who shoot like
  mad, but absolutely nothing went normal on this run. I mean... that rev's rocket
  after teleporting? I went for quit keys already. :)

  Of course the highlight of the run is what happens after the sphere. Usually
  the monsters block the way, everyone's a biter so it's hard to squeeze through
  even with 200 health and SSG blazing. Oh well, it's a breeze after the BK switch
  exploit.
  
  I guess this run was a karmic payoff for one previous run where I was reaching for
  a similar time, but I took a wrong turn and tried to exit on the start platform :)
  And I included a short demo showing off my spectacular skills with RL. ;)
