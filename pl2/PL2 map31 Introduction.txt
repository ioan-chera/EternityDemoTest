This is the remake of the original Cyberden from Plutonia Experiment, much harder, more space and more cyberdemon.

I don't have confidence to BFG all 6 cyberdmons as what tatsurd does, so I decided to kill them one by one. This
will lead the run much more slower. I to do some BFGs to save time.

I always afraid I may do silly mistakes again and killed. Anyway. below 9 minutes is OK.
