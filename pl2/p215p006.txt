Comments: Trick is a random occurence, and last time I tried Pacifist months ago when I recorded my -nomonsters run, the arch-viles would get in my way every time. Decided I'd give it another shot, and this demo came after maybe 8 minutes of play. First time I got the trick , the arch-viles just gladly opened the path up. As a matter of fact, this demo is two tics faster than my -nomonsters demo, which is very lucky for me.
