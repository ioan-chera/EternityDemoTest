Comments:  I followed blob1024's demo, I love the way he did this map. I like this map, it has a really well-done design and challenging difficulty. Beginning was f**king hard because of some tough enemies and there was not much health. I was afraid with 7 health but things got a bit easy after killing Arch-Vile and 2 spiders. I took the other way instead of killing remaining demons and spider. Then the Spiderdemon section was awesome, things got easy from here as I got plasma gun. Killing Cyberdemon was a lot of fun. After that, I took the spider route instead of taking teleporter to kill those remaining monsters. Then the exit was easy and I made it in 8:12 :)
