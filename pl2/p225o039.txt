Hmm, nice map to chill out. No, really! :) In nomonsters, I found this to
be a very relaxing map to run. It also helped that I didn't go for a few
hours on it like on MAP13 (with still no successful 53 in sight). I got
this time in about 20-25 minutes. That being said, it isn't optimized, but
my goal was to get this under 40 initially (I kept getting 41's at first,
a couple 42's, then a 40, etc). Then, I got 39. :)

Also, when you see me fumbling down those ice stairs, I think it's
unavoidable due to the low ceiling heights (it may be 56 for each stair--
the bare minimum for Doomguy, so he can't go down two stairs at once).
That's my guess anyway.

Nice map, Gusta. :)
