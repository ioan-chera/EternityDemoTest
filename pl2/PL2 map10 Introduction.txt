The music of this map "Astral Dreadnought" is one of my favourite music in PL2, it fits this map very well.

Does this map looks familiar? Indeed it is just a remake of doom2 map10, a refueling base feeling may gives you
another thought.

This map is not very hard, but the pain elementals and revenants are very annoying. The last archvile kill isn't
good, it wastes some SSG ammo and time to kill him. Unfortunately the door suddenly close and the archvile hurts me
, lucky I am not in low health yet. :)

I think under 8 minutes should be better, anyway I am still satisfied to get below 10 minutes. This is quite a
reasonable UV Max playthough.
