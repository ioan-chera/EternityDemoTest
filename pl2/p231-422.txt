Description:

A few hours work, so this run is not very good. 
At least, 10 - 15 seconds should be saved. Under 4 min is
probably possible, but very hard work is necessary to get it.

Pl2 has a lot of bugs, and correct UV-Max is impossible in
some maps, but they haven't been fixed for a long time.
I don't intend to do such hard work for pl2 until they are fixed
and the final version is released, though I don't know whether 
pl2 team really do it, or not.
