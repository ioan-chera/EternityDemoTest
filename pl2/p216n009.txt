  Description:

	Thank you Red-XIII for the credits :)
	yeah, a very easy lvl to manage...
	I think it was luck, but my 5th try to make this fast was succesful
	after I saw Red-XIII's run I was wondering why he didn't get manage 0:09
	so those are my first 5 runs today:
	1. died in the little room with the invulnerability sphere
	2. same
	3. 0:12 (lost time because the Archanatron blocked)
	4. bad beginning -> retry
	5. 0:09

	Sorry Red-XIII, but I have to say it like it is :), maybe you will manage 0:08 :)
	or even a run without the invulnerability sphere
	My credits goes to ...
			...Red-XIII, because it was him again, why I made this run :D
