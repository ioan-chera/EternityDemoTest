Comments: 
Had an idea about how to handle those enemies I deal with after grabbing the PGs in a more time-efficent manner.  It worked out very well here.

Even better, this is fastest I've ever killed the mancos before.  Quick and slick I say.

Still, for every good thing that happens, something else in the level must go wrong.  I could have had some better aiming at the BSK trap, I could have handled the final mobs in a slightly better fashion, and I could have not tried to nearly bite it at one point (It wouldn't be an AZ demo without it right?).

At the least, I hit my target improvement time of at least 10 or more seconds.  Sub-5 might be a possibility here.
