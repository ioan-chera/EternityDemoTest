Description:

I just wanted to punch few bastards onto their ugly faces. The demo is very slow because I got both
mancubi into very uncomfortable position so it took me a while to handle with them. The time could
go at least one minute faster, maybe even below 4 mins with more stunning play.
Includes also a bonus demo if you want to watch one mancubus attacks another one without any 
success :-)
