DANG DANG DANG!
I tried for 53, honestly I did... for two freaking hours after I got this
54. The result: a BUNCH of other 54's, some 55's, and a few 56's. I think
if I had more patience, I could get 53 eventually, but it's like pulling
teeth. (BTW, this may look easy to beat, but try and you'll see it's so
hard with so many walls on which you can get caught.)

On a positive note, I like the route. :) The only demos I saw were with
monsters, so ofc the runner uses the AV jump in a demo with monsters. No
AV's here, so I had to make my own route. It's possible to exit the map
with just the BSK. Who knew? :)

If somebody finds a better route, I'm gonna facepalm so hard..... then
I'll be happy for that person later. :P

BTW, I attached a demo with a bug to show you what can sometimes go wrong..
and it's VERY annyoing when this happens. It happened in about 10% of my
otherwise successful demos (1 in 10.. think about that if 10% doesn't
sound so bad). This bug demo DOES use a different route, since at first
I didn't know about the finalized route. The finalized route came to me in
one demo when I had the red key and accidently jumped through the little
window.. then I discovered I didn't need a red key at all.

Enjoy! :)
