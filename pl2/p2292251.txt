  I played as agressive as I could. This map is slow paced and it looks like the
  authors tried to keep the original Plutonia MAP29 feel hence there are some 
  really hard to reach monsters like that Mancubus and especially that Arch-Vile
  near the 2 Cybies/BSK area. I'd really love to push this under 20 mins but I
  don't see how I could do it. HUD used.
