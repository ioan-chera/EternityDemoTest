
Plutonia 2 - Map 30 - The Gatewatcher - NM100S% in 1:10


a little timid about this demo but i hope it seems satisfactory to you all!

took about only 15 tries, and just for dodging a little seemed to pay off.

of course, i didn't grab the orb from well, cybers getting bank shots on me whilst i pound out the boss. not to mention they spawn back if you aren't lucky enough...Enjoy!
