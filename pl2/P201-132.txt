  Description :)

  hmmm, thanks to skep's route, it's a great one
  I don't take the backpack at start which forces me to pick 
  some shells in the way, makes the run a little harder
  And one more thing, I don't play using the hud, so I didn't know I was close to beating skep's time
  at the end, I just risked it with chaigun that way, cause I guessed caco would probably be low on hp
  :D :D :D
