OMG I'm still jittering .. it's a first exit of course :)
Whew, can't really concentrate to write well right now .. anyway here we go:

Ok now, so first of all this is my favorite map of PL2 or even the best map
for DooM I've ever seen in my life. It's almost a shame to speed- oder maxrun
this fantastic masterpiece. First time I played it, I couldn't stop wondering
about the amazing leveldesign. That snake-demonized dungeon ist just epic.

How many times did I die trying this? Don't ask! Fortunately this map don't
bother me cuz I'm addicted to it (see above). Anyway this demo is far from
perfection. Maybe I'll improve it myself if there's no other challenger with
more considerable skills. Doing this below 10 should definitely be possible.
