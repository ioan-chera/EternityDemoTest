  Description:

  Finally everything worked as planned and lenghtily optimized.
  I've been training this for 3 days, starting at 1:23.
  This was my first glided map so I suppose it's an easy one :)
  The first SR50 jump, on the other hand, is a bitch. I killed
  both the shotgunners in the windows, because those bastards
  kept blowing the barrels when I was preparing the right angle.
  This was hell.
