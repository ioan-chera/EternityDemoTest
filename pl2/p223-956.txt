Plutonia 2 - map 23 in 9:56


 Description:

I have been running this map for the past 2 weeks on and off, my previous personal record was 10:42, 
I was aiming to beat tatsurd's record and I used his route, had some good runs but I screwd up more than a few times failing to strafe to the invulnerability powerup, 
or spending to much time hunting single cacodemons lol,
but overal I enjoyd doing the run, it is still very much improvable tho, I say to something like 8:xx.
