Comments:
I liked this boss battle so much, the environment felt pretty epic for me the
first time playing through. I also liked the design of the baphomet but its
shoulders look a bit flat and bland...   

After I grabbed the weapons & megasphere and teleported to fight the monster
I shot the 4 demons, which I sometimes only shoot 2 and let the others die from
infighting or maybe they could all die from infighting but I haven't tried that.
Also, I always had problem with cyberdemons cause when fighting one, another
cyberdemon could be shooting at me, so I had some good luck :)
When getting up the stairs ready to shoot the baphomet, it's easy to get hit by
monsters and fall off but this time the monsters put me in a good position hehe.
It could be done easier with longtics, as this would've made it a lot easier to
aim at the baphomet which in this map requires precise aiming to damage it.
