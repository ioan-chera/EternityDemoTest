  Description:

  Sweet map, really. Lovely death traps, almost no space
  for dodging, sexy detailing to get stuck on... heh.
  I drilled the route for some time before I got a butt-ugly
  1:24 that had to be erased from history, so 1:20 followed
  pretty fast. Then I tried provoking the red door chainies
  to avoid some later weapon switching. Works wonders, but
  kinda adds difficulty.

  The RJ is really easy and cheap on health if the chainies
  leave you alone... and lets you skip the YK room, yay!
  I had much bigger problems with pushing the cybie aside.
  He always ended sliding up the stairs, blocking my way.
  1:16 is just a third exit, I guess it can go much faster
  with better monster slaloming.
