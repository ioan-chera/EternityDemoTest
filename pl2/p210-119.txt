  Description:

  I hate myself for that ending. WHY?!?! 2 secs lost.
  I gradually pushed the time from cca 1:28, but this
  is the first one where I managed to do all the tricks
  I had in mind. And exited. :)

  The SR50 jump is pretty obvious. The linedef jump
  at where the PE is.. not so much, I found it by pure
  accident, but it's relatively easy. Thanks to Gusta
  for some advice on how making it reliable. It's not
  necessary and works even without monster boost, but
  it helps to set the bridge lottery to 'always win'.
  Also, there's a linedef dodge at the last bridge
  platform thanks to which the revs aren't released.

  I guess the 3rd archie was getting distracted and
  died so easy as a reward for that 2nd bastard. And
  yeah, that exit is just plain stupid :-/

  Oh btw.. MOST ANNOYING FIRST 20SECONDS EVER?!
