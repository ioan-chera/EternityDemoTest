  Description:

  I avoided a speedrun on this map at first, simply
  because it seemed too violent. There's so much
  switch-flipping, necessary linedef triggering and
  backtracking with more and more monsters porting
  in... it looked like one of those 5min 'speeds'.
  This feeling was reinforced when Gusta told me
  Angus didn't want any intentional major shortcuts 
  that would skip large parts of the map.
  
  Well guys, I'm glad to disappoint your designer
  intentions, I caught a big one. :) Finding this
  took some detective work in godmode and the demo
  might not be very clear on what's going on, so
  let me explain:

  The final door is opened by a red-labeled switch
  that doesn't actually require the RK. This area
  can be accessed by an archie jump from the other
  side (where the BFG is). There's a wall blocking
  that area, but it is lowered after stepping off
  the teleporter leading to the YK, when cacos port
  in. That way, just the BK is necessary, but it's
  trap makes the AVjump practically impossible due
  to health and crowd problems. Therefore, linedef
  skipping grab... makes the rest of the route kinda
  easy. Phew, wall of text. :)

  There's a bonus glide, saves cca ~10s of hunting
  the bars switch. It's easyish as far as glides go.
  And a second bonus of falling from the elevator,
  silly me. On the other hand, I've never been able
  to do the grab if I didn't screw something else
  already. Cost me 5secs or so. The rest of the run
  is relatively smooth and fast. Oh, I missed exit
  so it's not 1:49, ugh.
  I hate/love the map now.
