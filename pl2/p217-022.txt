  Description:

  This level is epic. So much chaos and non-linearity, great
  monster placement and combinations... It's almost a shame
  to exit it so fast. :) I hope someone does a good max, it's
  sure to look much more entertaining.
  
  The design is so chaotic I couldn't even find a fast route
  to the exit area. I tried an AVjump from the spawn area to
  that tiny ledge, but that's ungodly hard. Then I found out
  the right route sweetened by invisibility and blue armor
  and it was just two glides on the same spot, dancing around
  a cybie and a lovely teleport into a pack of chainies.
  Piece of cake! I actually did a cool 50s demo on that route,
  with awesome chainies infighting and cybie porting in late,
  and I was on my way to post it, but then my brain called
  and I went to check the map again... I'd swear that final
  trick wasn't there before :)

  So being down to just one glide and no worries with the cybie,
  I was trying over and over to have the monsters align
  in the right way and squeezing thru the bars fast enough.
  The cacos were maddening, they completely ignored I was
  supposed to be invisible and frenzy fired on me nightmare
  style all the time. The other problem was managing the piggies
  army so they don't block me or even worse the doors from
  closing (afaik they can't be closed manually?). Quick rush
  to berserk pack does the trick. And the glide is VERY easy...
  ...with nomonsters :)

  I'm happy with this time, It'd take too much trouble to cut
  down another sec or two. I included the previous route demo
  as well, because it's actually harder and better show :)
