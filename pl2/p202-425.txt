This demo didn't came easy. Goal was to push the time under 4:30 mark,
so I`m satisfied with my achievement. On other hand, the demo is pretty
ugly. Especially the moment when 2 revenant missles hit me one after
another and I didn`t even tried to dodge. What was I thinking? I dunno.
Time is still improvable. It`s clear that the map can be done in 4:1x.
