Comments:

This boss battle is so awesome! A very nice dark and creepy style.
I had to pause a moment here and there, so that the Cybers didn't hit me.
I decided not to kill a single Cyberdemon and hoped for some monster infighting,
but they forced me to fall off sometimes.
Although I needed three trys to shoot enough rockets from the raised column,
it's my personal best time and aiming. Anyway I think it can be beaten easily
from you freaks out there plus staying alive for sure.
