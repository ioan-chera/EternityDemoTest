  # Description:  #  HI folks :) I finally did it :)					#
  #################  It took me 2 whole days to finish this.   Last week I was talking  #
  # on zdaemon with dew, and he noticed that there was an hole on the level 11. I       #
  # had already played level 11 some months ago but I never tried to speedrun it.       #
  # Well... 3 days ago I decided to give it a try, so I studied the level as better as  #
  # I could. The first road I tried was the fastest, but I finished it just once since  #
  # it is really hard. Then I tried another route, a little longer but hard, and then I #
  # found this :) 									#
  # I was really slow in some parts and also really lucky ( expecially at the end :) )  #
  # The first arch-vile wasn't supposed to be killed at the beginning but at the end    #
  # and I've also been hit by lots of arch-viles.  The yellow key part is really boring #
  # sorry but I waste 1 minute there because I've never been good/luck on the glide,    #
  # sometimes I do the first one in 3 seconds and the second in 30 seconds, it's really #
  # frustating. 									#
  # When I reached the fake end, I decided that I couldn't die as I did lots and lots   #
  # of time. But luck was on my side and the arc went in pain, so I grab the megasphere #
  # and waited, hoping that 15 and more archs were nice with me, and it happened.       #
  # Oh btw, many times I tried to get the megaspgere behind the beginning, in my way    #
  # back from the yellow key, but I never jumped on, maybe I'm really a crap :) 	#
  # Well, I don't care if this is 1 minute over the time I aimed to reach, I'm proud of #
  # this and I'll improve it because a brilliant level like this has to be mine, and if #
  # you want to try ... be my guest, hope you like my road :))				#
  # BYE											#
