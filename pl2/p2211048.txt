Description:

1st exit. The beginning part was really tricky. The two doors to
the main area open and close by the switches. If you fight against
enemies from behind the door, you often return to the switch to open 
the door again. It's an inefficient way. Therefore, I wanted to charge
into the area, but I always died easily. Finally, I managed to find 
the way to make the safe position to fight against many enemies.
This run is as a whole pretty slow, and I fell into blood and lost about 
10 seconds. At least under 10 min should be gotten.
