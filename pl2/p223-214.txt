  Description:

  :))))) This is by far the craziest thing I managed to do.
  
  It's cca 150th attempt and it's the 3rd time I survived
  both the AV jumps. Once I got killed by that baron behind
  the bars, second time that demon bit me, what a shame.
  That said, please pardon the SUCK that is my 'running'
  after lowering the bars, I was playing with a load in my
  pants. :)

  I guess the normal route might be even faster than this,
  but I just had to do it. I'll leave optimizing for TASers.
  The AV is simply too idiotic. He keeps reviving the revs
  and they thank him by rockets in the back. So he kills them.
  And revives them again. Darwin awards, here he comes.
  
  Btw, I love the design around the start, it's awesome
  to max, looks great and there's plenty of totally crazy
  tricks to try - thanks to save&load I managed to jump
  across the bars by luring a second archie from the sphere
  secret and having two synced blasts throw me over. Even
  crazier was to use the archie + a rocket boost to jump
  from the plasma room window to the final doors room. :)
  On the other hand, I hate pretty much everything else
  in the map...

  Oh and if jumping over the bars is possible, I'm gonna cry.
