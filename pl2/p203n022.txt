My #3 entry for the International Beat a Cyberdemon531 Demo Week.

Welcome to superhell. Both passes through the start area are ridiculously deadly
and even if you do all the right dance moves, it's still up to luck if monsters
decide block and shred you. The tricks are far from consistent too, but the most
annoying part is the forced weapon juggling in the first 5 seconds.

Imagine my horror when the first exit after many hours was THAT other thing.
