Comments:

This ist just a modified demo (you may also call it "cheated" or whatever)
of my own regular(!) p230-056 because I had some time playing around with
the "Little Movie Processing Centre" (LMPC) utility.
Ok, so what changes were made and what makes the difference of p230bt43:
First of all there's the improvement of killing that Baphomet 13 seconds
faster from 56 to 43 because it doesn't really need more than one try to
shoot enough rockets into the skull's eye.
Furthermore the hero survived the battle this time and did a little
dance session in the end (both is optional at this "end-level" map).
I still lost some seconds at the beginning and did not use any Strafe50
movement, so this is probably not the best possible time at all.
