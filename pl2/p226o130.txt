Comments:
It took me a lot of effort to relearn that rjump, it's quite a bitch. Actually dying in the nukage after the keygrab is a real risk, thanks to LUT lottery damaging me _the picosecond_ I touch the green.

First exit where I got both the tricks (well, at least in the current decade). I would've loved to break 1:30, but that drunken moment in the pink corridor happened, heh. Finger memory was running ahead of what was happening onscreen.
