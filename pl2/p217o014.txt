After about 45 minutes, I got 15.20, but I wanted 14. I kept trying over
and over again, and finally got this after 35 more minutes. (Total time
spent to get this is 1 hour 20 minutes.) 

I realize this isn't the best looking demo, and 13 is definitely possible,
but it's pretty hard to get that glide that quickly and I'm all burned
out now. Still, I enjoyed this!
