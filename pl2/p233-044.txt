  Description:
  Anima's Claustrophobia map33 demo reminded me pl2 has a 33 too. :)
  This run is just so-so. I'm not content with it, but I couldn't get a faster exit,
  so whatever. There's some seconds lost on general slowliness, but the main problem
  is the glide.

  You know how Doomguy slides left-wise when you push straight against a wall?
  Well, sometimes (mostly), the AV blast 'reverses the polarity' and he slides right.
  This of course makes gliding the right hole much easier than the left (normal) one.
  Figuring this out made my head hurt while getting killed a lot. Of course it's
  annoying to check out which 'polarity' you have, but at least the probability
  of succeeding on the glide is higher. Optimum lies below 40.
