I got this in 10 minutes. :)

This is not a route I made up.. I knew this from when I watched Dew's
speedrun of all of PL2 in UV with monsters.

There are a couple of parts where the running could probably be smoother,
but I was ecstatic to get both switches pressed fairly quickly so soon in
my demorecording session. I also like the .91 at the end of my time!

Good luck to whoever tries for under 30s.. it'll probably be hard to get
the time down more than a second or so (using this route). I don't think
a better route exists, but one could for all I know.

Enjoy!

P.S. Before pressing the enter key to record this, I took a big gulp of
water and had it in my mouth. After I pressed both switches, I got really
excited and spit a little water onto my shirt. :P Obviously I didn't stop
playing just because of that. XD
