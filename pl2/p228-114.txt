  Description:
  Second exit. Small time wastes everywhere, perhaps most notable is the ~3s holdback
  with those pesky HKs. They're rather random, at least half my runs ended on them.
  Also, the elevator sequence, while impressive at first, lost it's appeal when I had
  to sit through it for 30th time. :)

  Included a zombie demo. Chainies owned me almost instantly after, but it's there.
