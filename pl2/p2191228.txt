Comments:

Holy shit, this took me a lot of time and tries. You can see myself
getting nervous in the end 'cause this is my first and only exit at all!
Main problem here wasn't that 2 Cybers rather than the 7 Arch-Viles
around the map. I used that Invul-Sphere for 3 of them, even there are
some dangerous situations later on where it also could be very useful.
This map needs a BFG so much more than others, but it has none.
At least I'm satisfied with this, but it surely can be beaten though.
My goal was to do this under 10min but that's up to you 'really' skilled
players out there.
