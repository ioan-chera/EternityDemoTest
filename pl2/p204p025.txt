  Description:

  A very low 25 that could be improved, but this just is a 1st exit rushjob.
  I don't feel like improving after my UV-speed ordeal. :) This route is intense
  from the first tick to the last and I really love how it looks on a successful
  demo, but it's so insanely luck based that the exits are really far inbetween.
