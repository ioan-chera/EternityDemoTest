Comments:

Another map I was initially in love with, and then I definitely started to HATE. At first glance it may look easy, but the disposition of the hitscanners, group of spawning monsters, PEs and the only 2 armours makes this a real pain... I was optimistic on getting a sub10 here rather soon, but I was wrong. I struggled first to get a sub11, after 4 10:5x I was about to leave the map but I tried some more time and thats the result. I find the final jump and exit-secret-flagged, rather silly btw. Don't really get a sense in that. I may return here in future, unless somebody else do me the favour of beating my crap run here. DSDA record was 11:03 by vdgg.
