  Description:

  I did a run with the same route as speed, just letting
  the chainies to massacre themselves. I was like "oh that
  was easy". Then I realized that "you're hurting those poor
  piggies with barrels, you noob". So it's this, because
  I don't see myself surviving the barrel jump triggered
  by monster fire.
  And I'm pretty sure that if someone asked the second arch
  if he's a retard, he'd answer "No, I'm a magical fairy
  merry-go-round, wheeee" while running in a circle until
  his head started to spin and he'd puke all over the BFG.
