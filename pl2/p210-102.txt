Comments:
RedXIII has shown me this AV jump a few months back in hopes I'd be luckier
in getting it to work. I took my sweet time, heh.
It's not the jump, but the d2m11-ish room that kills most of the attempts.
Also having to wait for the stupid ship every time could be used as torture
by CIA. Could go under a minute or even pacifist, but I'm quite sick of it.
