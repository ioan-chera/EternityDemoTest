Description:

When I played this map for the 1st time and came across the gap with the arch-vile, 
I thought this platform was a bit low.
when i was attacked by archvile it threw me onto the platform and then I was next to the exit.
It looks very easy, and turned out to be exactly that when i played it :)
nothing special...
The time is not unbeatable, I only want to show you how it works.
